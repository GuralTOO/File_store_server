Abstract

We extend the blindspot model for self-supervised de-
noising to handle Poisson-Gaussian noise and introduce an
improved training scheme that avoids hyperparameters and
adapts the denoiser to the test data. Self-supervised mod-
els for denoising learn to denoise from only noisy data and
do not require corresponding clean images, which are dif-
ficult or impossible to acquire in some application areas of
interest such as low-light microscopy. We introduce a new
training strategy to handle Poisson-Gaussian noise which
is the standard noise model for microscope images. Our
new strategy eliminates hyperparameters from the loss func-
tion, which is important in a self-supervised regime where
no ground truth data is available to guide hyperparame-
ter tuning. We show how our denoiser can be adapted to
the test data to improve performance. Our evaluations on
microscope image denoising benchmarks validate our ap-
proach.

Fluorescence microscopy is a vital tool for understand-
ing cellular processes and structures. Because fluorescence
imaging with long exposure times or intense illumination
may damage the cell sample through phototoxicity, fluo-
rescence microscopy images are typically acquired under
photon-limited conditions. However, safely imaging the
cell using low light conditions and/or low exposure times
unfortunately lowers the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), hin-
dering further analysis and interpretation of the resulting
images.

The SNR is the product of a combination of factors,
including exposure time, excitation intensity, and camera
characteristics. In fluorescence microscopy, the noise is
typically described by a Poisson-Gaussian model [6]. The
goal of image denoising is to computationally increase the

In recent years, deep learning methods using convolu-

causes photobleaching and ultimately kills the sample.

For these reasons, researchers have turned to self-
supervised approaches to denoising [2 (9) (11). In the
self-supervised setting, the learner only has access to low
SNR images. Of the recent approaches, blindspot neural
networks have shown the best performance. In this
work, we address two shortcomings of blindspot neural net-
works for self-supervised denoising:

1. We introduce a loss function appropriate for Poisson-
Gaussian noise which is the standard model for micro-
scope images;

2. We introduce an alternate training strategy which elim-
inates the need to regularize the loss function; this is
critical in the self-supervised setting where no ground
truth validation data is available to tune the regulariza-
tion strength.

In the following, we survey related work on self-
supervised denoising (Section[Ip, review the blindspot neu-
ral network approach to self-supervised denoising (Section

present the results of our evaluation and comparison to com-
peting methods on benchmark datasets (Section|4), and pro-
vide conclusions and directions for future work (Section[5).

1. Related Work
1.1. Traditional methods

Many traditional methods for denoising such as BM3D
65], non-local means (BJ, and weighted non-nuclear norm
minimizaiton perform denoising by comparing the
neighborhood of a pixel to other similar regions in the
image. The advantage of learning-based methods is that
they can also take advantage of examples from other im-
ages in the dataset beyond the input image to be denoised.
Other methods such as total-variation denoising [4] enforce
smoothness priors on the image which tend to lead to highly
quantized results.

While most previous methods for denoising are designed
for additive Gaussian noise; in the case of Poisson-Gaussian
noise, a variance stabilizing transform is applied to ap-
proximately transform the noise to be Gaussian. However,
these methods are designed explicitly for Poisson-Gaussian

noise [15].
1.2. Deep learning methods

At present, supervised deep learning methods for denois-
ing typically far outperform traditional and self-
supervised methods in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio
(PSNR). Most supervised methods apply a fully convolu-
tional neural network [14] [20] and simply regress to the
clean image.

Recently, several approaches to self-supervised denois-
ing have been developed. Some methods [22] use as a loss
function Stein’s Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE)
which estimates the mean squared error (MSE) between a
denoised image and the clean image without actually hav-
ing access to the clean image. An analogous estimator for
Poisson-Gaussian noise has been developed [12]. However,
these methods require a priori knowledge of the noise level
which is unrealistic in a practical setting. Our approach
supports blind denoising and adaptively estimates the noise
level at test time.

Lehtinen et al. 13] introduced a highly successful ap-
proach to self-supervised denoising called Noise2Noise. In
this approach, the network learns to transform one noisy in-
stantiation of a clean image into another; under the MSE
loss function, the network learns to output the expected
value of the data which corresponds to the clean image.
While this method can achieve results very close to a su-
pervised method, it requires multiple, corresponding noisy
images and thus is similarly limited in application in the live
cell microscopy context.

An alternate approach to self-supervised denoising
which does not require multiple noise instantiations of the
same clean image is to learn a filter which predicts the
center pixel of the receptive field based on the surround-
ing neighborhood of noisy pixels. By training such a filter
to minimize the MSE to the noisy input, the resulting fil-
ter will theoretically output the clean value [1] [9J. Laine
et al. refer to a neural network built around this con-
cept as a “blindspot neural network.” They improved upon
the blindspot concept by extending it to a Bayesian context
and introduced loss functions for pure Gaussian or Pois-
son noise, showing results very close to the supervised re-
sult when trained on synthetically noised data. However,
their method requires a regularization term in the loss func-
tion which can’t practically be tuned in the self-supervised
setting; in our evaluation we found that the regularization
strength indeed needs to be tuned for best results on differ-
ent datasets. Our method avoids the need for regularization
and outperforms the regularized version in our experiments.

Krull et al. {10} introduced Probabilistic Noise2Void
(PN2V) which takes a non-parametric approach to model-
ing both the noise distribution and the network output; how-
ever, their approach requires paired clean and noisy images
in order to calibrate the noise model. A recent follow-on
work called PPN2V [18] estimates the noise model using
a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) in a fully unsupervised
manner. Again, this approach involves several hyperparam-
eters controlling the complexity of the noise model which
need to be tuned, while ours does not. Additionally, in
our experiments, we show that our approach outperforms
PPN2V on several datasets.

page 3: 2. Self-supervised learning of denoising

The goal of denoising is to predict the values of a
“clean” image x = (21,...,%n) given a “noisy” image
y = (Y1,--+Yn). Let Qy, denote the neighborhood of
pixel y;, which does not include y; itself. We make two
assumptions that are critical to the setup of Noise2 Void
and follow-on works: that the noise at each pixel is sampled
independently, i.e. p(yi|r1,...,2%n) = p(yi|vi); and that
each clean pixel is dependent on its neighborhood, a com-
mon assumption about natural images. The consequence of
these assumptions is that 2, only gives information about
x;, not y;. Therefore a network trained to predict y; given
Q,, using a mean squared error loss will in fact learn to
predict x; 9} [I].

In this work, we take a probabilistic approach rather
than trying to regress to a single value. Following Laine
et al. and Krull et al. (10J, we can connect y; to its
neighborhood Q,, by marginalizing out the unknown clean
value xj:

pluils,) = f pluie) pleil®y,) des.)
{YS Ka— SS

Noisy observation Noise model Clean prior

Since we only have access to observations of y; for training,
this formulation allows us to fit a model for the clean data
by minimizing the negative log likelihood of the noisy data,
i.e. minimizing a loss function defined as

cmarginal _ y — log p(yi|Qy,)- (2)

a

In the following we will drop the Q,, to save space.
2.1. Poisson-Gaussian noise

In the case of Poisson-Gaussian noise, the noisy obser-
vation y; is sampled by first applying Poisson corruption to
x, and then adding Gaussian noise which is independent of
ax;. We have

yi = aP(x;/a) + N(0,b) (3)

where a > 0 is a scaling factor (related to the gain of the
camera) and b is the variance of the Gaussian noise compo-
nent, which models other sources of noise such as electric
and thermal noise [6].

We apply the common approximation of the Poisson dis-
tribution as a Gaussian with equal mean and variance:

yi © aN (x;/a,x;/a) + N(0,d) (4)
= N(a;,ax; +4 6). (5)

The noise model is then simply a Gaussian noise model
whose variance is an affine transformation of the clean
value. Note that in practice we allow b to be negative;
this models the effect of an offset or “pedestal” value in the
imaging system [6]. This general formulation encompasses
both pure Gaussian (a = 0) and Poisson noise (b = 0).

2.2. Choice of prior

In order to implement our loss function (Equation[2) we
need to choose a form for the prior p(x;|Qy,) that makes
the integral tractable. One approach is to use the conjugate
prior of the noise model p(y;|x;), so that the integral can be
computed analytically. For example, Laine et al. model
the prior p(2;|Qy,) as a Gaussian, so that the marginal is
also a Gaussian. Alternatively, Krull et al. take a non-
parametric approach and sample the prior.

In this work, similar to Laine et al. we model the
prior as a Gaussian with mean ju; and variance o?. We re-
place the ax term in Equation/4]with ap to make the integral
in Equation [2}tractable; this approximation should be accu-
rate as long as a? is small. The marginal distribution of y;
is then

(w) ! (
Yi = eX]
py 2n(ap; +b +07) P

and the corresponding loss function is

cmareinal (yi — pi)? + log(ap; +b4 2

a

(yi = Hi)?
2(ap; +b +0?)
(6)

2.3. Posterior mean estimate

At test time, ju; is an estimate of the clean value x; based
on Q,,, the neighborhood of noisy pixels around y;. How-
ever, this estimate does not take into account the actual
value of y; which potentially provides useful information
about x;.

Laine et al. and Krull et al. suggest to instead
use the expected value of the posterior to maximize the
PSNR of the resulting denoised image. In our case we have

yio? + (api + b) pi

8
ap; +b+ 0? &)

&; = Elp(ailyi)] =
Intuitively, when the prior uncertainty is large relative to
the noise estimate, the formula approaches the noisy value
yi; When the prior uncertainty is small relative to the noise
estimate, the formula approaches the prior mean [1;.

2.4. Blindspot neural network

In our approach, ju; and ? are the outputs of a blindspot
neural network and a and b are global parameters
learned along with the network parameters.

The “blind-spot neural network” is constructed in such a
way that the network cannot see input y; when outputting
the parameters for p(x;). The blindspot effect can be
achieved in multiple ways. Noise2Void [9] and Noise2Self
[1] replace a random subset of pixels in each batch and mask
out those pixels in the loss computation. Laine et al. [11] in-
stead construct a fully convolutional neural network in such

2.5. Regularization

In a practical setting, the parameters a and b of the noise
model are not known a priori; instead, we need to estimate
them from the data. However, an important issue arises
when attempting to learn the noise parameters along with
the network parameters: the network’s prior uncertainty and
noise estimate are essentially interchangeable without any
effect on the loss function. In other words, the optimizer
is free to increase a and b and decrease o?, or vice-versa,
without any penalty. To combat this, we add a regulariza-
tion term to the per-pixel loss which encourages the prior
uncertainty to be small:

regularized pmarginal 41> oil. (9)
i

We found in our experiments that the choice of 2
strongly affects the results. When . is too high, the prior
uncertainty is too small, and the results are blurry. When
is too low, the prior uncertainty is too high, and the network
does not denoise at all. Unfortunately, in the self-supervised
setting, it is not possible to determine the appropriate setting
of \ using a validation set, because we do not have ground
truth “clean” images with which to evaluate a particular set-
ting of A.

3. Learning an uncalibrated model

This realization led us to adopt a different training strat-
egy which defers the learning of the noise parameter models
to test time.

In our uncalibrated model, we do not separate out the
parameters of the noise model from the parameters of the
prior. Instead, we learn a single variance value 6,” repre-
senting the total uncertainty of the network. Our uncali-
brated loss function is then

cimealibrated _ y (“oe + lox(d)) (10)
on

a

At test time, however, we need to know the noise param-
eters a and b in order to compute o? = 6;? — apy — band
ultimately compute our posterior mean estimate #;.

If we had access to corresponding clean and noisy obser-
vations (x; and y;, respectively) then we could fit a Poisson-
Gaussian noise model to the data in order to learn a and b.
In other words, we would find

2
a,b = arg min, » > (a + log(ax; + ») .
i we
dt)

As we are in a self-supervised setting, however, we do
not have access to clean data. Instead, we propose to use
the prior mean ju; as a stand-in for the actual clean value x;.
This bootstrapping approach is similar to that proposed by
Prakash et al. ; however, they fit a general parametric
noise model to the training data where as we propose to fit
a Poisson-Gaussian model to each image in the test set.

Our approach is summarized in the following steps:

1. Train a blindspot neural network to model the noisy
data by outputting a mean and variance value at each
pixel, using the uncalibrated loss (Equation[I0).

2. For each test image:

i. Run the blindspot neural network with the noisy
image as input to obtain mean ju; and total vari-
ance 6,” estimate at each pixel.

ii. Determine the optimal noise parameters a,b by
fitting a Poisson-Gaussian distribution to the
noisy and psuedo-clean images given by the
mean values of the network output (Equation[12p.

iii. Calculate the prior uncertainty at each pixel as
o? = max(0.0001, 6)? — ay; — b).

iv. Use the noise parameters a, b and the calculated
prior uncertainties 7? to compute the denoised

image as the posterior mean estimate (Equation

We believe our approach has two theoretical advantages
over the bootstrap method proposed by Prakash et al. [18].
We can achieve a better fit to the data by training our sys-
tem end-to-end, whereas Prakash et al. impose a fixed
noise model during training by first estimating the noise
parameters and then training the network. Second, we es-
timate noise parameters for each image separately at test
time, whereas Prakash et al. estimate common noise
parameters for all images first and fixes those parameters
during training. Our approach allows for slight deviations in
the noise parameters for each image, which might be more
realistic for an actual microscope imaging system where the
camera configuration slightly fluctuates between images.

4. Experiments and Results
4.1. Implementation details

Our implementation uses the Keras library with Tensor-
flow backend. We use the same blindspot neural network
architecture as Laine et al We use the Adam optimizer
with a learning rate of 0.0003 over 300 epochs, halving
the learning rate when the validation loss plateaued. Each
epoch consists of 50 batches of 128 x 128 crops from ran-
dom images from the training set. For data augmentation

To fit the Poisson-Gaussian noise parameters at test
time, we apply Nelder-Mead optimization with (a =
0.01,b = 0) as the initialization point. We cut off data in
the bottom 2% and top 3% of the noisy image’s dynamic
range before estimating the noise parameters.

4.2. Datasets
4.2.1 Synthetic Data

We generate a synthetic dataset using the ground truth im-
ages of the Confocal MICE dataset from the FMD bench-
mark [26] (described below). For training, we use the
ground truth images from 19 of the 20 views and gener-
ate 50 noisy examples of each view by synthetically adding
Poisson-Gaussian noise to the ground truth images using
equation [3] where a = 1/X and b = (0/255). For test-
ing, we use the ground truth image from the 20th view
and generate 50 noisy examples by synthetically adding
Poisson-Gaussian noise in the same manner as during train-
ing. To ensure our method works for a wide range of
noise levels, we train/test our method on all combinations
(A, a) € {0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50} x {0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50}.

microscope images captured with various imaging setups
and types of samples. Testing on real data gives us a more

the ground truth images are created by averaging the noisy
images in each view. We trained a denoising model on the
raw noisy images in each dataset separately.

Prakash et al. evaluated PPN2V on three sequences
from a confocal microscope, imaging Convallaria, Mouse
Nuclei, and Mouse Actin. Each sequence consists of 100
noisy images and again the clean image is computed as the
average of the noisy images. Whereas the FMD dataset pro-
vides 8-bit images clipped at 255, these images are 16-bit
and thus are not clipped. Following their evaluation pro-
cedure, each method is trained on all 100 images and then
tested on a crop of the same 100 images; this methodol-
ogy is allowable in the self-supervised context since no la-
bel data is used during training.

4.3. Experiments

In the following we will refer to the competing methods
under consideration as

¢ Regularized (Ours):  Blindspot neural network
trained using the regularized Poisson-Gaussian loss
function (Equation|2) with regularization strength \.

¢ Uncalibrated (Ours): Blindspot neural network
trained using the uncalibrated loss function (Equation
with noise parameter estimation done adaptively at

test time (Section.

¢ N2V: Noise2Void which uses the MSE loss function
and random masking to create the blindspot effect [9].

¢ PN2V: Probabilistic Noise2 Void — same setup as N2V
but uses a histogram noise model created from the
ground truth data and a non-parametric prior [10].

* Bootstrap GMM and Bootstrap Histogram: PPN2V
training — same setup as PN2V but models the noise
distribution using either a GMM or histogram fit to the
Noise2Void output [18].

* U-Net: U-Net trained for denoising in a super-
vised manner using MSE loss [24].

¢ N2N: Noise2Noise training using MSE loss [13].

4.3.1 Noise parameter estimation

We first evaluate whether our bootstrap approach to esti-
mating the Poisson-Gaussian noise parameters is accurate
in comparison to estimating the noise parameters using the
actual ground truth clean values.

To evaluate our bootstrapping method, we compare the
ground truth and estimated Poisson-Gaussian noise models
fit for a test image in each dataset in the FMD benchmark
[26]. Figure[2|shows that the Poisson-Gaussian pdfs gener-
ated using our bootstrapping technique closely match that of
the Poisson-Gaussian pdfs generated from the ground truth
images.

We further evaluate our approach by comparing the loss
and estimated Poisson-Gaussian noise parameters obtained
when using actual ground truth data or the pseudo-clean
data generated in our bootstrap method. Table[I]shows that
bootstrapping can provide an accurate estimation of noise
parameters and result in a loss similar to that obtained from
using ground truth clean data. Here the loss value is

We further evaluate our approach by comparing the loss and estimated Poisson-Gaussian noise parameters obtained when using actual ground truth data or the pseudo-clean data generated in our bootstrap method.

We perform a similar evaluation on our synthetic dataset
where instead of having to estimate the true noise param-
eters from fitting a Poisson-Gaussian noise model with the
ground truth clean image we readily have available the true
noise parameters that correspond to the level of syntheti-
cally added Poisson-Gaussian noise. Table[2|shows the true
noise parameters as well as the ones obtained using our un-
calibrated method and the method described by Foi et al.
in [6]. Our method tends to overestimate the a parameter,
whereas the estimate of the b parameter is consistently ac-
curate. This is probably because a majority of the pixels in
the Confocal MICE images are dark and thus there are not

many good samples for fitting the level of Poisson noise,
whereas every pixel can be effectively used to estimate the
Gaussian noise no matter the underlying brightness. Unlike
the method of Foi et al. [6] which obtains poor noise esti-
mates most likely because of this, our method is still able to
obtain a good estimate of the parameters by leveraging in-
formation from both the noisy image and our pseudo-clean
image.

The effectiveness of fitting a Poisson-Gaussian noise
model at test time is further evaluated in Table[3]which pro-
vides a comparison of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) on
a subset of our synthetic dataset. Our method of estimating
the noise parameters with our bootstrapping technique con-
sistently improves the denoised results of the pseudo-clean
image, but is ultimately bounded by the result obtained from

rameters. Results for all noise parameter combinations are
given in the supplemental material.

43.2 Effect of regularization

To highlight the difficulties of hyperparameter tuning in the
self-supervised context, we trained our uncalibrated model
and several regularized models on the FMD datasets. We
tested a regularization strength of A = 0.1, 1, and 10.

The results are shown in Table [4] The test set PSNR
of the regularized model varies greatly depending on the
setting of A, and indeed a different setting of \ is optimal
for each dataset. This indicates that hyperparameter tuning
is critical for the regularized approach, but it is not actually
possible in a self-supervised context.

In contrast, our uncalibrated method outperforms the
regularized method at any setting of A, and does not require
any hyperparameters.

4.3.3 Comparison to state-of-the-art

Next we present the results of our performance evaluation
on the FMD and PPN2V benchmark datasets. Table
shows a comparison between our uncalibrated method and
various competing methods, including self-supervised and
supervised methods.

Between the fully unsupervised methods that do not re-
quire paired noisy images (our Uncalibrated method, N2V,
Bootstrap GMM, and Bootstrap Histogram), our method
outperforms the others on four out of six datasets. A com-

parison of denoising results on both benchmark datasets are
shown in Figures [3]and|4]

5. Conclusions and Future Work

Noise is an unavoidable artifact of imaging systems, and
for some applications such as live cell microscopy, denois-
ing is a critical processing step to support quantitative and
qualitative analysis. In this work, we have introduced a
powerful new scheme for self-supervised learning of de-
noising which is appropriate for processing of low-light im-
ages. In contrast to the state-of-the-art, our model handles
Poisson-Gaussian noise which is the standard noise model
for most imaging systems including digital microscopes. In
addition, we eliminate the need for loss function regulariza-
tion in our method, thus making self-supervised denoising
more practically applicable. Our evaluation on real datasets
show that our method outperforms competing methods in
terms of the standard PSNR metric on many datasets tested.

Our work opens up new avenues in live-cell imaging
such as extreme low-light imaging over long periods of
time. Future work lies in extending our model to other
noise models appropriate to other imaging modalities, and
exploring whether our uncalibrated method could be com-
bined with a non-parametric prior [10].

page 10: A. Derivation of Poisson-Gaussian Loss Func-
tion

In self-supervised denoising, we only have access to
noisy pixels y; and not the corresponding clean pixels 2;.
Similar to a generative model, we use the negative log-
likelihood of the training data as our loss function:

Li = — log p(y) (1)
However, for denoising we are interested in learning a

model for p(x;), not p(y:). We relate p(x;) to p(y) by
marginalizing out x; from the joint distribution:

P(yi) = / (yin wide (2)
= [ rlulesyotedae 8)

In other words, we integrate p(y;, 2;) = p(yi|xi)p(a) over
all possible values of the clean pixel x;.

Here, p(y;|2;) is simply our chosen noise model. p(x;)
constitutes our prior belief about the value of x; before we
have seen an observation of y;. We do not know what form
the prior should take; it is essentially up to us to choose.
Usually we use the conjugate prior of the noise model be-
cause this makes the integral tractable.

Our loss function term for pixel 7 will then be

A.1. Gaussian noise

For zero-centered Gaussian noise, p(y;|x;) is the normal
distribution centered at x; with variance equal to 72. We
choose p(x;) to be the normal distribution as well. Here
we have the network output the parameters of the Gaussian,
mean ju; and std. dev. o;.

The marginalized pdf is derived as follows:

p(vi) = / plyilra)p(ai)ae: 6)

ance o? +o2.

The loss function is then

A.2. Poisson noise

For high enough values of X;, the Poisson distribution
P(A) can be approximated by a Gaussian N’(A, A) with
mean and variance equal to A. Using this idea, Laine et
al. adapt the above formulation for Gaussian noise to
the Poisson noise case. However, they introduce an approx-
imation in order to evaluate the integral.

Let a be the scaling factor s.t. y/a ~ P(a/a) where x
and y are in the range [0 1]. The noise model using a normal
approximation is y = a(x/a+N(0,x/a)) = 2+N(0, az).
The proper joint distribution for this model is thus

Fea? (“Sten )

1 exp ( (a — pr)

However, Laine et al. replace the variance of the noise dis-
tribution with ay;. This makes the integral tractable. They
argue that this approximation is okay if a? is small.

We can easily extend the Poisson loss function above to
Poisson-Gaussian by adding a noise variance b to the model.
Following the derivation above, our loss function is

(yi = Ha)?
(ap; + b+ 0?)

+ log(ap; +b +02). (16)

B. Posterior mean estimate

The blind-spot network ignores the actual measured
value for y; when it makes a prediction for z;. However,
y; contains extra information which can be used to improve
our estimate of xj.

C. Results

C.1. Gaussian noise

While our method is meant for denoising images with
Poisson-Gaussian noise, we also test our methods ability to
denoise pure Gaussian noise. We evaluate two variants of
our noise estimation method by comparing the estimated a,b
parameters to the ground truth parameters for every noise
level, o € {10, 20,30, 40,50}, of our synthetic Gaussian
noise Confocal MICE dataset. When we can make the as-
sumption that Gaussian noise is the type of noise that exists
in an image, we show that an improvement can be made in
denoising quality by making a small change to our method
to fit pure Gaussian noise parameters.

Table[I]provides results obtained on our synthetic dataset
in which Estimated represents a,b parameters obtained us-
ing our Poisson-Gaussian noise fitting, while G-Estimated
represents our estimated a,b parameters using our Gaussian
noise fitting method which can be accomplished by simply
fixing a = 0 for our Poisson-Gaussian noise fitting tech-
nique. While our Poisson-Gaussian noise fitting technique
typically provides a better estimate of the b parameter than
the Gaussian noise fitting method, our Poisson-Gaussian
noise fitting obtains an incorrect estimate of a unlike our
Gaussian noise fitting. This worse estimate of a contributes
to an overall worse denoising quality than the quality ob-
tained by estimating the noise parameters with Gaussian
noise fitting which is shown in Table This is because
the Gaussian noise fitting parameters result in a more accu-
rate estimate of the computed noise variance due to the a
parameter being known.

C.2. Poisson noise

We perform the same denoising experiments on images
with varying levels of Poisson noise. Once again, we show
that we can improve the denoising quality by modifying our
Poisson-Gaussian noise fitting technique to fit Poisson noise
when we can make the assumption that pure Poisson noise
is present in an image. This can be done by simply fixing
b = 0 for our Poisson-Gaussian noise fitting technique.

Table 3] shows a comparison between ground truth and
estimated a,b noise parameters for every noise level, A €
{10, 20, 30, 40, 50}, of our synthetic Poisson noise Confo-
cal MICE dataset. Estimated and P-Estimated represent our
estimated a,b parameters using our Poisson-Gaussian and
Poisson noise fitting techniques, respectively. While our
Poisson-Gaussian noise fitting provides decent estimates of
the a,b parameters, using the pure Poisson noise fitting can
provide almost exact estimates of both parameters. Table 3]
shows that our Poisson noise fitting technique results in a
PSNR close to that obtained using the ground truth param-
eters. While the Poisson-Gaussian noise fitting results in a
worse denoising quality than the Poisson noise fitting, an
improvement in denoising quality is still obtained over the
pseudo-clean image.

C.3. Poisson-Gaussian noise

To further evaluate our bootstrapping method, we com-
pare our estimated a,b parameters to the ground truth ones
for every noise level, (A,0) € {10,20,30,40,50} x
{10, 20,30, 40,50}, of our synthetic Poisson-Gaussian
noise Confocal MICE dataset. Table[5]shows the results ob-
tained for all the Poisson-Gaussian noise levels. The ground
truth a,b parameters correspond to the (A,o) noise level
synthetically added to the clean images while the estimated
a and b are the parameters learned from fitting a Poisson-
Gaussian noise model using our bootstrapping technique.

page 12: We further evaluate our approach on our synthetic
dataset by comparing the PSNR obtained by our bootstrap-
ping method for all the noise level combinations. Table [6]
compares the PSNR achieved by the pseudo-clean image
which is the output of the blindspot neural network, the im-
age obtained by our bootstrapping method, as well as the
image obtained when the ground truth a,b parameters are
known rather than learned.

C.4. Noise Parameter Estimation

To further study how effective our bootstrapping tech-
nique is we evaluate how the PSNR is affected by vari-
ous levels of error in our estimates of the a,b parameters.
Since the error in our estimation of the a parameter is dif-
ferent than the error in our estimation of the b parameter
we select different percent errors for each parameter. The
initial percent errors are chosen by computing the aver-
age percent error of our estimation of the noise parame-
ters over all noise levels, (A, 7) € {0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50} x
{0, 10, 20,30, 40,50}, of our synthetic Confocal MICE
dataset. We then select the other two percent errors to be
one standard deviation below and above the average percent
errors.

Table [7] provides results of the PSNR obtained for the
different percent errors in the a,b parameters on a Confocal
MICE dataset with synthetically added Poisson-Gaussian
noise (A/a = 30). As mentioned before, our estimation
of the a parameter is much worse than the b parameter most
likely due to the Confocal MICE dataset containing many
dark pixels. Even when using the worst percent errors for
our a,b parameters though we still obtain an increase in
PSNR from the pseudo-clean image which shows that even
a poor estimation using our method can still help denoise
an image. We also note that the PSNR actually increases
with an increase in percent error in the estimate of the b pa-
rameter, which can best be explained by our method always
overestimating the a parameter and underestimating the b
parameter. In practice, a worse estimate of the b parameter
helps compensate for the overestimation of the a parameter,
providing a better approximation of the noise variance.

C.5. BSD68

We also provide results for our method on the BSD68
dataset. We follow the experiment in [9] and train our model
on 400 gray scale images and test on the gray scale ver-
sion of the BSD68 dataset. Both the training and testing
dataset have synthetically added zero mean Gaussian noise
with standard deviation 0 = 25.

We evaluate our method on the BSD68 dataset by com-
paring the PSNR obtained using BM3D, a supervised train-
ing method, Noise2Noise, Noise2Void, and three different
outputs of our model: the blindspot neural network, the out-
put obtained estimating the noise parameters, and the output

obtained using the true noise parameters. While our method
is not expected to perform better than the supervised train-
ing method or Noise2Noise, it should perform better than
Noise2Void. Table [8] compares the different outputs of our
model to the various state-of-the-art methods. We observe
that the PSNR of the output of the blindspot neural net-
work, or pseudo-clean image, is significantly worse than
the PSNR of the output of the Noise2 Void method, but when
our Poisson-Gaussian noise fitting technique is used we out-
perform Noise2Void. Similar to Noise2Void, our method
performs worse than BM3D which is most likely due to us-
ing too small of a training set to obtain the best possible
pseudo-clean image from the blindspot neural network.

We further evaluate our method by comparing our esti-
mated a,b parameters to the ground truth noise parameters.
Table [9] shows that our method obtains only a decent esti-
mate of the a,b parameters. As mentioned, this is probably
due to the pseudo-clean image not being close enough to the
ground truth clean image to provide a good estimate of the
ground truth noise parameters from our Poisson-Gaussian
noise fitting technique.

Abstract

Background: Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) hold enormous promise in accelerating breakthroughs in
understanding human development, drug screening, disease modeling, and cell and gene therapies. Their potential,
however, has been bottlenecked in a mostly laboratory setting due to bioprocess challenges in the scale-up of large
quantities of high-quality cells for clinical and manufacturing purposes. While several studies have investigated the
production of hiPSCs in bioreactors, the use of conventional horizontal-impeller, paddle, and rocking-wave mixing
mechanisms have demonstrated unfavorable hydrodynamic environments for hiPSC growth and quality maintenance.
This study focused on using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling to aid in characterizing and optimizing the
use of vertical-wheel bioreactors for hiPSC production.

Methods: The vertical-wheel bioreactor was modeled with CFD simulation software Fluent at agitation rates between
20 and 100 rpm. These models produced fluid flow patterns that mapped out a hydrodynamic environment to guide
in the development of hiPSC inoculation and in-vessel aggregate dissociation protocols. The effect of single-cell
inoculation on aggregate formation and growth was tested at select CFD-modeled agitation rates and feeding regimes
in the vertical-wheel bioreactor. An in-vessel dissociation protocol was developed through the testing of various
proteolytic enzymes and agitation exposure times.

Introduction
Engineering approaches to understand and control stem
cell behavior are needed to address major technology
bottlenecks in bioprocessing knowledge [1-3]. Pluripo-
tent stem cells have a high in vitro proliferation capacity
and maintain the ability to differentiate into all three
germ layers of the human body, making them an ideal
cell platform for biomedical engineering applications [4—8].
With the ability to overcome ethical challenges associated
with traditional embryonic cell sources, human induced
pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are of particular interest in
research, clinical and manufacturing markets. Despite the
demand for hiPSC production, a lack of standardized
protocols and challenges with large-scale expansion to
meet relevant cell quantities have prevented many ad-
vances in the field [9-11]. The number of high-quality cells
required for treatment ranges from 10° to 10’ depending
on the therapeutic target, with therapeutic efficacy directly
correlating to cell dose [12]. Bioreactors are the method of
choice for controlled cell expansion, offering advantages
including reduced labor and operating costs, greater
cellular homogeneity, and more efficient cell expansion
and differentiation capabilities compared to laboratory-
scaled static culture flasks [13]. A drawback to the bioreac-
tor environment is the potential for cells to be damaged by
high shear stress which can tear apart cells and cell aggre-
gates, resulting in lower cell quality and cell yield [14].
While several studies have investigated the production
of hiPSCs in bioreactors, the use of conventional
horizontal-impeller, paddle, and rocking-wave mixing
mechanisms has demonstrated unfavorable hydro-
dynamic environments for hiPSC growth and quality
maintenance. Current studies achieve only moderate
cell fold increases during the expansion phase, and
there exists a lack of scalable protocols for the inocu-
lation and harvesting phases [15-21].

A major hurdle for hiPSC expansion in bioreactors has
been defining a scalable cell inoculation protocol that

Results: CFD modeling demonstrated the unique flow pattern and homogeneous distribution of hydrodynamic forces
produced in the vertical-wheel bioreactor, making it the opportune environment for systematic bioprocess
optimization of hiPSC expansion. We developed a scalable, single-cell inoculation protocol for the culture of hiPSCs as
aggregates in vertical-wheel bioreactors, achieving over 30-fold expansion in 6 days without sacrificing cell quality. We
have also provided the first published protocol for in-vessel hiPSC aggregate dissociation, permitting the entire
bioreactor volume to be harvested into single cells for serial passaging into larger scale reactors. Importantly, the cells
bioreactors not only maintained consistent growth kinetics,
they maintained a normal karyotype and pluripotent characterization and function.

Conclusions: Taken together, these protocols provide a feasible solution for the culture of high-quality hiPSCs at a
clinical and manufacturing scale by overcoming some of the major documented bioprocess bottlenecks.

successfully maintains cell growth rates without sacri-
ficing cell quality. Single-cell enzymatic dissociation of
hPSCs has been reported to result in a drastic loss of cell
viability. Thus, hPSCs are generally plated as clumps and
grown as colonies or aggregates [11]. Even with a static
growth platform, non-colony-type monolayers have re-
sulted in low cell production and reported chromosomal
abnormalities and potential selection pressure for mu-
tated cells [22, 23]. While clump seeding has been widely
reported as an inoculation strategy for bioreactor culture
[24-30], it produces a bottleneck in scalability. It is also
difficult to control the clump size, resulting in hetero-
geneity of bioreactor aggregates leading to increased
apoptosis and spontaneous differentiation [11, 24]. To
avoid the formation of large aggregates prone to necrotic
centers, optimal cell inoculation methods and passaging
schedules should be determined. Single-cell inoculation
methods have been tested with traditional bioreactor
models; however, studies have required large cell seeding
densities which resulted in low cell production [11].
Downstream hiPSC bioreactor operations also lack
scalable protocols. Harvesting is a critical step in serial
passaging and recovery of the final cell product [9], but
excessive shear during the harvesting process can alter
cell phenotype [31]. Few studies have investigated
potential methods for full bioreactor harvesting of
hiPSC aggregate culture. Publications only collect
small (1-5 mL) aggregate samples from the bioreactor
to dissociate for cell counts using enzymatic and
mechanical dissociation techniques which cannot be
translated to harvesting [9, 10, 32].
In this study, we utilized computational fluid dynam-
ics (CFD) modeling to map out the hydrodynamic
environment of a vertical-wheel bioreactor produced
by PBS Biotech, Ltd. Hydrodynamic forces are difficult
to study empirically due to confounding dynamic vari-
ables present at any given instant [33]. CFD modeling
can be applied to understand hydrodynamics in stirred

CFD model allowed us to confirm that the vertical-

the vertical-wheel bioreactor would make it the ideal

lenges in hiPSC bioprocess scale-up. Table 1 highlights
the major geometrical differences and known advantages
of the proposed vertical-wheel bioreactor compared to
traditional horizontal-blade bioreactors [36]. By adjusting
the vertical-wheel operating parameters, we showed
success in single-cell hiPSC inoculation resulting in over
30-fold expansion in 6 days. This could not be mimicked
in traditional horizontal-blade bioreactors which produced
heterogenous cell aggregates and minimal cell expansion
when seeded as single cells. Using enzymatic dissociation
within the agitated vertical-wheel bioreactor, we designed
a harvesting protocol capable of achieving a recovery
efficiency of over 95%. The optimized inoculation and
harvesting protocols were combined in a serial passage
and scale-up study that showed reproducible hiPSC
growth that maintains a normal karyotype, a positive
expression of pluripotency markers, and the functional
ability to differentiate into all three germ layers.

Materials and methods

Computational fluid dynamics modeling

The 100-mL vertical-wheel bioreactor (PBS Biotech,
Camarillo, USA) was modeled with CFD simulation
software Fluent 16.2 (ANSYS Inc. Cannonsburg, USA).
Fluent employs a finite volume formulation to numeric-
ally solve CFD models. Virtual geometry models of the
reactor were created using the computer-aided design
(CAD) software AutoCAD and imported into the mesh-
ing software ICEM ANSYS. The reactor geometry was
discretized using tetrahedral elements and boundary
conditions were prescribed at different surfaces. Wall
boundary conditions were applied to the vessel wall and
impeller, indicating regions of zero normal velocity and
no tangential velocity relative to the wall (no slip condi-
tion). The liquid surface was modeled with a free surface
boundary condition, defining a fixed, frictionless wall
with no tangential velocity restrictions, and zero normal
velocity. The impeller rotation was implemented using a
moving reference frame with an interface boundary condi-
tion used between the rotating and stationary domains.

A semi-implicit method for pressure-linked equations
(SIMPLE) algorithm was used to numerically solve the
realizable k-epsilon Navier-Stokes equations. The k-
epsilon model is one of the most widely used turbulent
models for simulating the hydrodynamic environment in
suspension bioreactors [37-39] and has been validated
with particle image velocimetry (PIV) [40]. Navier-Stokes

utilizes Eqs. 1 and 2 to represent the transport of mass
and momentum through viscous fluid:

uy. = 1
5p + ¥ (eu) (1)
opu 2

oat V(pu®u) = - VP +yuV*u+t pg (2)

In the above equations, p is the density, u is the Carte-
sian velocity vector, t is time, P is pressure, # is viscosity,
and g is the gravity vector. Water at 37°C with a density
of 0.993 g/cm, a dynamic viscosity of 7.01 x 10 *kg/
(m s), and kinematic viscosity of 0.696 mm7?/s was used
to simulate the fluid inside the reactor. In order to rep-
resent turbulence in the system, the realizable k-epsilon
model implements two additional transport equations to
account for kinetic energy and energy dissipation rate.

All equations were discretized using a second-order
upwind scheme. Models were generated at agitation
rates of 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 rpm, each run for a flow
time of 5s with time steps chosen to ensure the
Courant-Friedrich-Lewy (CFL) number remained below
1. This guaranteed that the fluid element would cross
from one end of the mesh element to the other in a sin-
gle time step. Post processing was performed on each
simulated model to derive velocity, shear stress (force
acting on a surface parallel to the plane in which it lies),
and energy dissipation rate (energy lost by viscous
forces) distributions.

Static culture of hiPSCs

hiPSC line 4YA, passage numbers 40 to 45, were used
for all experiments in this study. These cells were ob-
tained from Dr. James Ellis’ laboratory at the University
of Toronto (Toronto, Canada). For expansion prior to
inoculation in bioreactor culture, hiPSCs were grown in
T-75 flasks (Cat#156599, Thermo Scientific) maintained
under standard culture conditions (37°C and 5% COb).
Flasks were coated with feeder-free substrate hESC-
qualified Matrigel (Cat#354277, Corning Life Sciences)
in DMEM/Hams F-12 (Cat#10-090-CV, Corning Life
Sciences) for 2h at room temperature. The cells were in-
oculated into T-75 flasks at a density of 15,000 cells/cm?
with 15 mL/flask mTeSR1 medium (Cat#85851, STEM
CELL Technologies) supplemented with 10 uM Y-27632
(Cat#72304, STEMCELL Technologies). Daily medium
replacements were carried out, excluding the addition of
Y-27632. When approximately 80% confluency was
reached (3-4 days), hiPSCs from static were passaged.
Static cultures were washed once with Ca”*- and Mg”*-
free phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and treated with 5
mL/flask 0.5 mM EDTA-4Na Accutase (Cat#07920, STEM
CELL Technologies) supplemented with 10 uM Y-27632
and incubated at 37°C for 5 min. Medium supplemented

with 10 uM Y-27632 was added at a 1:1 ratio of Accutase
to dilute the enzyme. The culture was then transferred to
a conical tube to be centrifuged at 300g for 5 min. The
supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was resus-
pended in a medium supplemented with 10 uM Y-27632
to be counted and inoculated into bioreactor culture.

Suspension culture of hiPSCs

This study used 100-mL working volume horizontal-
blade, glass bioreactors (Corning Style Spinner Flask,
NDS Technologies Inc.) and 100-mL and 500-mL work-
ing volume single-use, vertical-wheel bioreactors (PBS
Biotech Ltd). Constant mixing was maintained at agita-
tions rates of 40, 60, and 80rpm in standard culture
conditions of 37°C and 5% COy. hiPSCs were inoculated
at a density of 20,000 cells/mL and cultured at
maximum working volumes (100mL and 500mL) of
mTeSR1 medium supplemented with 104M Y-27632.
Experiments utilized either single-cell or pre-formed
aggregate inoculation methods. Bioprocess parameters,
including the selected low cell seeding density and
protocol used to pre-form aggregated cell clumps, were
adopted from a previous study as a positive control to
compare single-cell inoculation in the vertical-wheel bio-
reactor [41]. When inoculated as single cells, hiPSCs re-
moved from static culture were counted and added
directly into the agitated bioreactor culture. When inoc-
ulated as pre-formed aggregates, hiPSCs removed from
static culture were counted and inoculated into 6-well
suspension culture plates (Cat#657-185, Greiner CELL
STAR) at a concentration of 200,000 cells/cm? in 2.0
mL/well mTeSR1 supplemented with Y-27632. Wells
were left in the incubator for 4h to pre-form aggregated
cell clumps which were then inoculated into the
bioreactor.

Experiments studying the effects of nutrient availability
in 100 mL and 500 mL fed-batch conditions involved a
50% mTeSR1 medium exchange (excluding Y-27632) on
day 4 of culture. To perform the medium exchange, bio-
reactors were brought under a laminar flow hood where
cell aggregates settled for 5 min. Media were aspirated
from the top surface of the bioreactor and added to a
conical tube to be centrifuged at 300g for 3 min. Media
from the conical tube were discarded, and the remaining
cell pellet was resuspended in fresh mTeSR1 media to
be added back into the bioreactor.

Cell counts and aggregate sizing

To study the growth kinetics of hiPSCs in bioreactor
culture, daily samples were taken with cell counts
performed in duplicates. Samples of 1.0—5.0mL were
removed using a serological pipette during bioreactor
agitation to minimize settling of the aggregates. The
samples were centrifuged at 300g for 5 min. The supernatant

was discarded, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 1.0 mL
of Accutase and left in a 37°C water bath for 5—7 min. The
cell solution was then gently pipetted 3 times followed by the
addition of 1.0 mL of the medium used to dilute the enzyme.
The sample was centrifuged at 500g for 5 min, the super-
natant was discarded, and the cell pellet was resuspended in
0.5-1.0 mL medium. Two, 200 pL aliquots were taken from
each cell sample for viable cell counts using the Nucleo-
Counter NC-200 (ChemoMetec, Denmark), an automated
cassette counter which analyzes samples stained with fluores-
cent dyes Acridine Orange and DAPI. These counts were
used to generate cell growth curves and calculate fold expan-
sion utilizing Eq. 3:

Xx:
Fold expansion = — (3)
Xx

where X, and X, are the viable cell densities (cells/mL)
at the beginning and end of the culture passage.

To determine average aggregate size and size distribu-
tions, 1.5-mL samples were removed using a serological
pipette from the bioreactors and added into 12-well
plates for visualization. Images were taken using a Zeiss
Axiovert 25 microscope (Carl Zeiss) with AxioVision
software used for measurements. Aggregates were de-
fined as multi-cellular spheroids with a diameter greater
than 50 um. The diameter for each aggregate was deter-
mined by taking the average of the greatest length across
the aggregate and the length perpendicular to the great-
est length. A minimum of 100 aggregates were sized per
condition.

Bioreactor harvesting

An in-vessel harvest protocol was developed through the
testing of various proteolytic enzymes and agitation ex-
posure times. Proteolytic enzymes tested were Accutase
(Cat#07922, STEMCELL Technologies), TrypLE (Cat#
12605028, ThermoFisher), and 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA
(Cat#25300062, ThermoFisher). The bioreactor was
brought under the laminar flow hood where aggregates
settled for 5 min. Media from the bioreactor were aspi-
rated into conical tubes, leaving approximately 3 mL of
aggregate culture in the bioreactor. Conical tubes were
centrifuged at 300g for 5 min. Media from the conical
tubes were discarded, and the remaining cell pellets were
resuspended in 20 mL of proteolytic enzyme with 10 hM
Y-27632 and added back into the bioreactor aggregate
culture. The bioreactor was then placed back in the in-
cubator (37°C, 5% CO.) and agitated at 80 rpm. Every
5 min, for a total of 30 min, the bioreactor was quickly
brought under the laminar flow hood where 200-uL
samples were removed for cell counts and phase-
contrast imaging. Cell counts were performed using the
NucleoCounter NC-200 to obtain a viable cell density

and a percent of cells in aggregates (defined by the in-
strument as a cluster of 5 or more cells). To calculate
the dissociation efficiency at each time point, Eq. 4 was
used:

A
Dissociation Efficiency = BX 100 - cells in aggregates
(4)

where variables A and B are total cell numbers in the
reactor before and after the harvesting procedure. The total
cells in the reactor prior to harvesting were calculated
through Eq. 5:

cell
A= Aves sample count x reactor volume predissociation
m
(5)

where the average sample count was determined
through bioreactor cell samples (1.0 mL) dissociated via
traditionally counting methods described above. The re-
actor volume predissociation was the sum of the media
transferred to conical tubes and the remaining aggregate
culture in the bioreactor (approximately 3 mL). Total
cells in the reactor after the harvesting procedure was
calculated through Eq. 6:

at . wae
B= Ave sample count x reactor volume post dissociation
(6)

where the average sample count was determined from
the 200-uL samples taken directly from the bioreactor
during the harvesting procedure. The reactor volume
post dissociation was the sum of the proteolytic enzyme
volume added to the bioreactor (20mL) and the
remaining aggregate culture in the bioreactor prior to
harvesting (approximately 3 mL).

Karyotyping

Samples of bioreactor-generated aggregates were incu-
bated in 10-mL bioreactors in medium supplemented with
0.1 ug/mL KaryoMax Colcemid (Cat#15212012, Thermo-
Scientific) for 4h. The aggregates were then enzymatically
dissociated as previously described. Single cells were
collected by centrifugation, suspended in 0.075M KCl
hypotonic solution (Cat#P217-500, Fischer Scientific), and
incubated at 37°C for 25 min. Cells were then fixed with
3:1 methanol to acetic acid solution (Cat#A412-4, Fisher
Scientific, Cat#AX0073, EMD), and chromosome prepara-
tions were GTG-banded using standard cytogenetic tech-
niques. Karyograms were analyzed according to the ISCN
standards at ~ 450 band resolution using the Ikaros karyo-
typing system (Metasystems).

Abstract

Background: Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) hold enormous promise in accelerating breakthroughs in
understanding human development, drug screening, disease modeling, and cell and gene therapies. Their potential,
however, has been bottlenecked in a mostly laboratory setting due to bioprocess challenges in the scale-up of large
quantities of high-quality cells for clinical and manufacturing purposes. While several studies have investigated the
production of hiPSCs in bioreactors, the use of conventional horizontal-impeller, paddle, and rocking-wave mixing
mechanisms have demonstrated unfavorable hydrodynamic environments for hiPSC growth and quality maintenance.
This study focused on using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling to aid in characterizing and optimizing the
use of vertical-wheel bioreactors for hiPSC production.

Methods: The vertical-wheel bioreactor was modeled with CFD simulation software Fluent at agitation rates between
20 and 100 rpm. These models produced fluid flow patterns that mapped out a hydrodynamic environment to guide
in the development of hiPSC inoculation and in-vessel aggregate dissociation protocols. The effect of single-cell
inoculation on aggregate formation and growth was tested at select CFD-modeled agitation rates and feeding regimes
in the vertical-wheel bioreactor. An in-vessel dissociation protocol was developed through the testing of various
proteolytic enzymes and agitation exposure times.

Aggregate immunocytochemistry

Aggregate samples containing 1E6 cells were removed
from the bioreactor culture and added into microcentri-
fuge tubes (Cat#10011-724, VWR). Aggregates were
rinsed twice with PBS and resuspended in 0.5 mL of fix-
ation buffer (Cat#FC001, R&D Systems) to be incubated
for 1h at room temperature. Aggregate samples were
then rinsed twice with PBS and resuspended in 200-uL
permeabilization buffer (Cat#FC005, R&D Systems) with
1 ug/10° cells antibody stain and 14M/10° cells nuclei
stain and incubated for 3h at room temperature. Conju-
gated antibody stains for SSEA-4 (Cat#FAB1435F, R&D
Systems), TRA-1-60 (Cat# FAB4770P, R&D Systems),
and Nanog (Cat#MABD24A4, Millipore Sigma) were
used along with the nuclei stain To-Pro-3 Iodide Nucleic
Acid Stain (Cat#T3605, Thermo Fisher). Cells were then
rinsed twice with PBS and imaged using a Carl Zeiss
Laser Scanning Microscope 700 with lasers at 488 nm
and 639 nm and corresponding filter sets.

Tri-lineage differentiation

Bioreactor-cultured hiPSC aggregates were differentiated
into cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes, and neural rosettes
using the previously published protocols [42-44]. The
aggregates were collected on day 12 post-inoculation
and were either dissociated into single cells as described
in the “Materials and methods” section or directly plated
as aggregates for in vitro differentiation. For both cardio-
myocyte and hepatocyte differentiation, hiPSCs were
seeded at a density of 2E5 cells/plate on Matrigel-coated
FluoroDish Cell Culture Dish plates (Cat#FD35-100,
World Precision Instrument) containing mTeSR1
supplemented with Y-27632 and cultured to 80-90%
confluency before undergoing differentiation [42, 43].
Mature cardiomyocytes and hepatocytes at day 20 of
differentiation were used for the analysis. For neural
rosette differentiation, hiPSC aggregates were cultured
on poly-L-ornithine (Cat#A-004-C, Sigma Aldrich)-
coated FluoroDish cell culture dish plates in DMEM/
F12 medium supplemented with 5% KnockOut serum
replacement (Cat# 10828010, Thermo Fisher Scientific),
0.1mM_ non-essential amino acids (Cat# 11140050,
Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol
(Cat#21985023, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 1%
penicillin-streptomycin (Cat#15140122, Thermo Fisher
Scientific) for 4 days. Further, the aggregates were
transferred onto Matrigel-coated plates in Neurobasal™
Medium (Cat#21103049, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supple-
mented with B27 without retinoic acid (Cat#12587010,
Thermo Fisher Scientific), N2 supplement (Cat#17502048,
Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.005% bovine serum albumin
(Cat#15260037, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 1mM _ so-
dium pyruvate (Cat#11360-070, Thermo Fisher Scientific)
for an additional 5days before analysis. Differentiated

cardiomyocytes and hepatocytes were analyzed by
whole-mount immunostaining and confocal imaging
using Cardiac Troponin T antibody (Cat#MA5-12960,
5 g/mL, Thermo Fisher Scientific), HNF-4-alpha anti-
body (Cat#ab92378, 1:100, Abcam), and CYP3A4 antibody
(Cat# MA5-17064, 1:200, Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Neural rosettes were analyzed using Pax-6 (Cat# PRB-
278P, 1:100, BioLegend) and Tubulin B 3 (TUBB3)
(Cat#801202, 1 g/mL, BioLegend) antibodies.

RNA isolation and reverse transcription (RT) quantitative
(q) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (RT-qPCR)

hiPSC aggregates were collected on day 6 and day 12
post-inoculation and used for RNA isolation. Total RNA
was extracted using PureLink” RNA Mini Kit
(Cat#12183018A, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to
the manufacturer protocol, followed by DNAse I digestion
using DNAse I Amplification Grade (Cat#18068015,
Thermo Fisher Scientific). Next, 500 ng RNA was used for
cDNA synthesis using Superscript” IV Reverse Transcript-
ase (Cat#18090010, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 50 uM
Oligo (dT)20 Primer (Cat#18418020, Thermo Fisher
Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
To quantitate transcripts, the subsequent RT-qPCR gene
expression analysis was performed on Applied Biosystems
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) using Fast SYBR™ Green Mas-
ter Mix (Cat#4385612, Thermo Fisher Scientific). For each
sample, relative mRNA expression was quantified relative
to the housekeeping gene GAPDH and was normalized to
static cultured hiPSC level (= 1). The relative quantifica-
tion (RQ) was completed based on comparative Cy
(AAC) through the 24°" method. The gene expression
results are shown as relative mRNA expression (RQ) to
static cultured hiPSCs (RQ = 1). At least two technical and
three biological replicates were assayed for all quantitative
RT-PCR reactions. Pluripotency-associated genes, Oct-4,
Sox2, Nanog, KIf4, and Rexl, were used for RT-qPCR.
The primer sequences for SYBR Green probe are listed in
Supplementary Table 1.

Statistics

Statistical analysis was done using GraphPad Prism
(v6.0). A one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett mul-
tiple comparison test was used for all growth curve and
aggregate size comparisons. Cell samples were collected
from n =4 stirred suspension bioreactors at each condi-
tion. The P values were set at 0.05, and all graphs are
presented with a + standard error of the mean (SEM). A
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by
Tukey’s multiple comparison test was used for RT-qPCR

Introduction
Engineering approaches to understand and control stem
cell behavior are needed to address major technology
bottlenecks in bioprocessing knowledge [1-3]. Pluripo-
tent stem cells have a high in vitro proliferation capacity
and maintain the ability to differentiate into all three
germ layers of the human body, making them an ideal
cell platform for biomedical engineering applications [4—8].
With the ability to overcome ethical challenges associated
with traditional embryonic cell sources, human induced
pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are of particular interest in
research, clinical and manufacturing markets. Despite the
demand for hiPSC production, a lack of standardized
protocols and challenges with large-scale expansion to
meet relevant cell quantities have prevented many ad-
vances in the field [9-11]. The number of high-quality cells
required for treatment ranges from 10° to 10’ depending
on the therapeutic target, with therapeutic efficacy directly
correlating to cell dose [12]. Bioreactors are the method of
choice for controlled cell expansion, offering advantages
including reduced labor and operating costs, greater
cellular homogeneity, and more efficient cell expansion
and differentiation capabilities compared to laboratory-
scaled static culture flasks [13]. A drawback to the bioreac-
tor environment is the potential for cells to be damaged by
high shear stress which can tear apart cells and cell aggre-
gates, resulting in lower cell quality and cell yield [14].
While several studies have investigated the production
of hiPSCs in bioreactors, the use of conventional
horizontal-impeller, paddle, and rocking-wave mixing
mechanisms has demonstrated unfavorable hydro-
dynamic environments for hiPSC growth and quality
maintenance. Current studies achieve only moderate
cell fold increases during the expansion phase, and
there exists a lack of scalable protocols for the inocu-
lation and harvesting phases [15-21].

A major hurdle for hiPSC expansion in bioreactors has
been defining a scalable cell inoculation protocol that

Results: CFD modeling demonstrated the unique flow pattern and homogeneous distribution of hydrodynamic forces
produced in the vertical-wheel bioreactor, making it the opportune environment for systematic bioprocess
optimization of hiPSC expansion. We developed a scalable, single-cell inoculation protocol for the culture of hiPSCs as
aggregates in vertical-wheel bioreactors, achieving over 30-fold expansion in 6 days without sacrificing cell quality. We
have also provided the first published protocol for in-vessel hiPSC aggregate dissociation, permitting the entire
bioreactor volume to be harvested into single cells for serial passaging into larger scale reactors. Importantly, the cells
bioreactors not only maintained consistent growth kinetics,
they maintained a normal karyotype and pluripotent characterization and function.

Conclusions: Taken together, these protocols provide a feasible solution for the culture of high-quality hiPSCs at a
clinical and manufacturing scale by overcoming some of the major documented bioprocess bottlenecks.

successfully maintains cell growth rates without sacri-
ficing cell quality. Single-cell enzymatic dissociation of
hPSCs has been reported to result in a drastic loss of cell
viability. Thus, hPSCs are generally plated as clumps and
grown as colonies or aggregates [11]. Even with a static
growth platform, non-colony-type monolayers have re-
sulted in low cell production and reported chromosomal
abnormalities and potential selection pressure for mu-
tated cells [22, 23]. While clump seeding has been widely
reported as an inoculation strategy for bioreactor culture
[24-30], it produces a bottleneck in scalability. It is also
difficult to control the clump size, resulting in hetero-
geneity of bioreactor aggregates leading to increased
apoptosis and spontaneous differentiation [11, 24]. To
avoid the formation of large aggregates prone to necrotic
centers, optimal cell inoculation methods and passaging
schedules should be determined. Single-cell inoculation
methods have been tested with traditional bioreactor
models; however, studies have required large cell seeding
densities which resulted in low cell production [11].
Downstream hiPSC bioreactor operations also lack
scalable protocols. Harvesting is a critical step in serial
passaging and recovery of the final cell product [9], but
excessive shear during the harvesting process can alter
cell phenotype [31]. Few studies have investigated
potential methods for full bioreactor harvesting of
hiPSC aggregate culture. Publications only collect
small (1-5 mL) aggregate samples from the bioreactor
to dissociate for cell counts using enzymatic and
mechanical dissociation techniques which cannot be
translated to harvesting [9, 10, 32].
In this study, we utilized computational fluid dynam-
ics (CFD) modeling to map out the hydrodynamic
environment of a vertical-wheel bioreactor produced
by PBS Biotech, Ltd. Hydrodynamic forces are difficult
to study empirically due to confounding dynamic vari-
ables present at any given instant [33]. CFD modeling
can be applied to understand hydrodynamics in stirred

Fig. 1a, was modeled at agitation rates between 20 and
100rpm. Figure 1b displays the change in volume
average hydrodynamic variables (velocity, shear stress,
and energy dissipation rate) from when the model was
initiated through 5 s of flow time. Steady state is reached
between 2 and 3s for all tested agitations, evident by the
plateau in measured values. The exception being 100
rpm, where the volume average energy dissipation rate
continues to fluctuate between 3.7E-3 m?/s® and 4.7E-3
m’/s> due to an increase in turbulent energy. Both
volume average velocity and volume average shear stress
increase in a linear fashion with respect to agitation rate.
Conversely, volume average energy dissipation rate in-
creases exponentially with respect to agitation rate. It is
evident from the vertical slices in the bioreactor (Fig. 1c)
that at a lower operating condition, 40rpm, hydro-
dynamic forces within the reactor are very consistent.
The distribution in energy dissipation rate throughout
the reactor height is particularly narrow, with no notice-
able changes within the rotating domain at the given
colorimetric scale. At a higher operating condition, 100
rpm, hydrodynamic forces show an increase in variability
within the reactor volume, with much greater forces
acting around the impeller blades. The difference in
maximum force values, which are often calculated to
keep constant in scale-up, are orders of magnitude
higher than the volume average values. At 100 rpm, for
instance, the maximum energy dissipation rate is 8.9E-1
m?/s® whereas the volume average energy dissipation
rate is 4.2E-3 m?/s®. What is particularly interesting is
the CFD generated flow patterns within the vertical-
wheel bioreactor, shown in Fig. 2. The velocity stream-
lines in the vertical-wheel bioreactor display a lemnis-
cate (figure-eight) profile. Unlike traditional horizontal-
impeller bioreactors, the fluid in the vertical-wheel re-
actor moves throughout the entire liquid width and
height. The fluid streamlines weave between the pitched
wheel blades with increased velocity corresponding to an
increase in agitation.

Single-cell bioreactor inoculation

To first investigate the potential of single-cell inocula-
tion, hiPSCs were seeded into 100-mL working volume
horizontal-blade and vertical-wheel bioreactors operated
at 40rpm, 60rpm, and 80rpm for 6days of batch
culture. As is evident from the growth curve and fold-
expansion data (Fig. 3a), single-cell inoculation of
hiPSCs in the vertical-wheel reactor was quite successful,
reaching a maximum expansion of 16.7 + 1.1-fold at 40
rpm. In contrast, fold expansion in the horizontal-blade

Page 7 of 19

bioreactor was minimal, reaching a maximum of 6.3 +
2.7-fold at 80rpm. The reduced cell yield in the
orizontal-blade reactor is likely linked to poor mixing
that results in large, heterogeneous aggregates pictured
in Fig. 3b. The aggregate distribution graphs for the
orizontal-blade reactor (Fig. 3c) acquire either bi-model
eaks or large, flat distributed averages, indicative of un-
ealthy aggregate morphology. By day 5 of culture,
iPSC aggregates in the horizontal-blade reactors
reached over 400 um in diameter. Beyond this aggregate
size threshold, necrosis is expected to occur with low
levels of oxygen and nutrients diffusing into the center
of the aggregate, resulting in heterogeneity in cell growth
and differentiation potential [45]. hiPSCs cultured in the
vertical-wheel bioreactors maintained consistent aggre-
gate sizes with a single, narrow peak distribution at all
tested agitation rates. Day 5 average aggregate sizes in
the vertical-wheel reactor seeded with single cells
remained below the threshold aggregate size, ranging
between 169.44m+5.5um and 275.45 um+6.9 um in
diameter at 80 rpm and 40 rpm respectively.

Next, pre-formed aggregate inoculation and single-cell
inoculation methods were compared in the vertical-
wheel bioreactors. Under batch culture conditions, there
were no differences in growth at corresponding agitation
rates (Fig. 4a), with aggregate morphology remaining
consistent between inoculation methods (Fig. 4b). At the
tested agitation rates and inoculation methods, the cells
experienced a lag phase on day 1 and entered the
exponential growth phase on day 2 of culture. Batch and
fed-batch single-cell inoculation in the vertical-wheel
bioreactors was then compared (Fig. 4a’). At all tested
agitation rates, fed-batch culture resulted in maximum
fold expansions that were approximately twice that of
batch culture conditions (Fig. 4c). Final cell concentra-
tions at 40 rpm were significantly higher than those at
60rpm and 80rpm, with a maximum expansion of
32.3 + 3.2-fold reached on day 6 of fed-batch culture.
While there were significant differences in average
aggregate size between the tested agitation rates, with
average aggregate size decreasing in correspondence to
an increase in agitation rate, average aggregate size
within each agitation rate seeded as pre-formed or single
cells remained the same (Fig. 4d).

Bioreactor harvesting

An optimized in-vessel harvesting protocol was devel-
oped by studying the effects of enzyme type and agita-
tion exposure time on the dissociation efficiency and
percentage of cells in aggregates. Accutase, TrypLE, and
0.05% Trypsin-EDTA were tested at exposure times of 5,
10, 15, 20, 25, and 30min. A large reduction in the
percent of aggregates occurred between 5 and 10min
for all tested enzymes (Fig. 5a). A further decrease in the

ity, proliferation, pluripotency, and differentiation. The
CFD model allowed us to confirm that the vertical-
wheel platform uniquely combines radial and axial flow
components producing more uniform distributions of
hydrodynamic forces and better scalability compared
to traditional bioreactor geometries [34, 35]. We
hypothesized that the hydrodynamic environment of
the vertical-wheel bioreactor would make it the ideal
platform for protocol development to overcome chal-
lenges in hiPSC bioprocess scale-up. Table 1 highlights
the major geometrical differences and known advantages
of the proposed vertical-wheel bioreactor compared to
traditional horizontal-blade bioreactors [36]. By adjusting
the vertical-wheel operating parameters, we showed
success in single-cell hiPSC inoculation resulting in over
30-fold expansion in 6 days. This could not be mimicked
in traditional horizontal-blade bioreactors which produced
heterogenous cell aggregates and minimal cell expansion
when seeded as single cells. Using enzymatic dissociation
within the agitated vertical-wheel bioreactor, we designed
a harvesting protocol capable of achieving a recovery
efficiency of over 95%. The optimized inoculation and
harvesting protocols were combined in a serial passage
and scale-up study that showed reproducible hiPSC
growth that maintains a normal karyotype, a positive
expression of pluripotency markers, and the functional
ability to differentiate into all three germ layers.

Materials and methods

Computational fluid dynamics modeling

The 100-mL vertical-wheel bioreactor (PBS Biotech,
Camarillo, USA) was modeled with CFD simulation
software Fluent 16.2 (ANSYS Inc. Cannonsburg, USA).
Fluent employs a finite volume formulation to numeric-
ally solve CFD models. Virtual geometry models of the
reactor were created using the computer-aided design
(CAD) software AutoCAD and imported into the mesh-
ing software ICEM ANSYS. The reactor geometry was
discretized using tetrahedral elements and boundary
conditions were prescribed at different surfaces. Wall
boundary conditions were applied to the vessel wall and
impeller, indicating regions of zero normal velocity and
no tangential velocity relative to the wall (no slip condi-
tion). The liquid surface was modeled with a free surface
boundary condition, defining a fixed, frictionless wall
with no tangential velocity restrictions, and zero normal
velocity. The impeller rotation was implemented using a
moving reference frame with an interface boundary condi-
tion used between the rotating and stationary domains.

A semi-implicit method for pressure-linked equations
(SIMPLE) algorithm was used to numerically solve the
realizable k-epsilon Navier-Stokes equations. The k-
epsilon model is one of the most widely used turbulent
models for simulating the hydrodynamic environment in
suspension bioreactors [37-39] and has been validated
with particle image velocimetry (PIV) [40]. Navier-Stokes

tested enzymes. After 20 min, the percent of aggregates
remains plateaued, indicating no further dissociation
activity was occurring. When comparing enzyme types,
the percent of aggregates remaining and the dissociation
efficiency at the end of 20 min were considered. The dis-
sociation efficiency at 20 min was calculated by compar-
ing cell sample counts prior to the full reactor harvest
with samples taken during the harvest and factoring in
the percent of cells that remained in aggregates. Of the
tested enzymes, 0.05% Trypsin resulted in the poorest

performance, with a calculated dissociation efficiency of
82.9% + 10.0%. The use of Accutase resulted in the high-
est dissociation efficiency of 95.2% + 4.0% and was there-
fore selected as the optimal enzyme for the in-vessel
harvest protocol (Fig. 5b).

utilizes Eqs. 1 and 2 to represent the transport of mass
and momentum through viscous fluid:

uy. = 1
5p + ¥ (eu) (1)
opu 2

oat V(pu®u) = - VP +yuV*u+t pg (2)

In the above equations, p is the density, u is the Carte-
sian velocity vector, t is time, P is pressure, # is viscosity,
and g is the gravity vector. Water at 37°C with a density
of 0.993 g/cm, a dynamic viscosity of 7.01 x 10 *kg/
(m s), and kinematic viscosity of 0.696 mm7?/s was used
to simulate the fluid inside the reactor. In order to rep-
resent turbulence in the system, the realizable k-epsilon
model implements two additional transport equations to
account for kinetic energy and energy dissipation rate.

All equations were discretized using a second-order
upwind scheme. Models were generated at agitation
rates of 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 rpm, each run for a flow
time of 5s with time steps chosen to ensure the
Courant-Friedrich-Lewy (CFL) number remained below
1. This guaranteed that the fluid element would cross
from one end of the mesh element to the other in a sin-
gle time step. Post processing was performed on each
simulated model to derive velocity, shear stress (force
acting on a surface parallel to the plane in which it lies),
and energy dissipation rate (energy lost by viscous
forces) distributions.

Static culture of hiPSCs

hiPSC line 4YA, passage numbers 40 to 45, were used
for all experiments in this study. These cells were ob-
tained from Dr. James Ellis’ laboratory at the University
of Toronto (Toronto, Canada). For expansion prior to
inoculation in bioreactor culture, hiPSCs were grown in
T-75 flasks (Cat#156599, Thermo Scientific) maintained
under standard culture conditions (37°C and 5% COb).
Flasks were coated with feeder-free substrate hESC-
qualified Matrigel (Cat#354277, Corning Life Sciences)
in DMEM/Hams F-12 (Cat#10-090-CV, Corning Life
Sciences) for 2h at room temperature. The cells were in-
oculated into T-75 flasks at a density of 15,000 cells/cm?
with 15 mL/flask mTeSR1 medium (Cat#85851, STEM
CELL Technologies) supplemented with 10 uM Y-27632
(Cat#72304, STEMCELL Technologies). Daily medium
replacements were carried out, excluding the addition of
Y-27632. When approximately 80% confluency was
reached (3-4 days), hiPSCs from static were passaged.
Static cultures were washed once with Ca”*- and Mg”*-
free phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and treated with 5
mL/flask 0.5 mM EDTA-4Na Accutase (Cat#07920, STEM
CELL Technologies) supplemented with 10 uM Y-27632
and incubated at 37°C for 5 min. Medium supplemented

with 10 uM Y-27632 was added at a 1:1 ratio of Accutase
to dilute the enzyme. The culture was then transferred to
a conical tube to be centrifuged at 300g for 5 min. The
supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was resus-
pended in a medium supplemented with 10 uM Y-27632
to be counted and inoculated into bioreactor culture.

Suspension culture of hiPSCs

This study used 100-mL working volume horizontal-
blade, glass bioreactors (Corning Style Spinner Flask,
NDS Technologies Inc.) and 100-mL and 500-mL work-
ing volume single-use, vertical-wheel bioreactors (PBS
Biotech Ltd). Constant mixing was maintained at agita-
tions rates of 40, 60, and 80rpm in standard culture
conditions of 37°C and 5% COy. hiPSCs were inoculated
at a density of 20,000 cells/mL and cultured at
maximum working volumes (100mL and 500mL) of
mTeSR1 medium supplemented with 104M Y-27632.
Experiments utilized either single-cell or pre-formed
aggregate inoculation methods. Bioprocess parameters,
including the selected low cell seeding density and
protocol used to pre-form aggregated cell clumps, were
adopted from a previous study as a positive control to
compare single-cell inoculation in the vertical-wheel bio-
reactor [41]. When inoculated as single cells, hiPSCs re-
moved from static culture were counted and added
directly into the agitated bioreactor culture. When inoc-
ulated as pre-formed aggregates, hiPSCs removed from
static culture were counted and inoculated into 6-well
suspension culture plates (Cat#657-185, Greiner CELL
STAR) at a concentration of 200,000 cells/cm? in 2.0
mL/well mTeSR1 supplemented with Y-27632. Wells
were left in the incubator for 4h to pre-form aggregated
cell clumps which were then inoculated into the
bioreactor.

Experiments studying the effects of nutrient availability
in 100 mL and 500 mL fed-batch conditions involved a
50% mTeSR1 medium exchange (excluding Y-27632) on
day 4 of culture. To perform the medium exchange, bio-
reactors were brought under a laminar flow hood where
cell aggregates settled for 5 min. Media were aspirated
from the top surface of the bioreactor and added to a
conical tube to be centrifuged at 300g for 3 min. Media
from the conical tube were discarded, and the remaining
cell pellet was resuspended in fresh mTeSR1 media to
be added back into the bioreactor.

Cell counts and aggregate sizing

To study the growth kinetics of hiPSCs in bioreactor
culture, daily samples were taken with cell counts
performed in duplicates. Samples of 1.0—5.0mL were
removed using a serological pipette during bioreactor
agitation to minimize settling of the aggregates. The
samples were centrifuged at 300g for 5 min. The supernatant

Their potential, however, has been bottlenecked in a mostly laboratory setting due to bioprocess challenges in the scale-up of large quantities of high-quality cells for clinical and manufacturing purposes.

Post processing was performed on each simulated model to derive velocity, shear stress (force acting on a surface parallel to the plane in which it lies), and energy dissipation rate (energy lost by viscous forces) distributions. Static culture of hiPSCs hiPSC line 4YA, passage numbers 40 to 45, were used for all experiments in this study. These cells were ob- tained from Dr. James Ellis’ laboratory at the University of Toronto (Toronto, Canada). For expansion prior to inoculation in bioreactor culture, hiPSCs were grown in T-75 flasks (Cat#156599, Thermo Scientific) maintained under standard culture conditions (37°C and 5% COb).

was discarded, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 1.0 mL
of Accutase and left in a 37°C water bath for 5—7 min. The
cell solution was then gently pipetted 3 times followed by the
addition of 1.0 mL of the medium used to dilute the enzyme.
The sample was centrifuged at 500g for 5 min, the super-
natant was discarded, and the cell pellet was resuspended in
0.5-1.0 mL medium. Two, 200 pL aliquots were taken from
each cell sample for viable cell counts using the Nucleo-
Counter NC-200 (ChemoMetec, Denmark), an automated
cassette counter which analyzes samples stained with fluores-
cent dyes Acridine Orange and DAPI. These counts were
used to generate cell growth curves and calculate fold expan-
sion utilizing Eq. 3:

Xx:
Fold expansion = — (3)
Xx

where X, and X, are the viable cell densities (cells/mL)
at the beginning and end of the culture passage.

To determine average aggregate size and size distribu-
tions, 1.5-mL samples were removed using a serological
pipette from the bioreactors and added into 12-well
plates for visualization. Images were taken using a Zeiss
Axiovert 25 microscope (Carl Zeiss) with AxioVision
software used for measurements. Aggregates were de-
fined as multi-cellular spheroids with a diameter greater
than 50 um. The diameter for each aggregate was deter-
mined by taking the average of the greatest length across
the aggregate and the length perpendicular to the great-
est length. A minimum of 100 aggregates were sized per
condition.

Bioreactor harvesting

An in-vessel harvest protocol was developed through the
testing of various proteolytic enzymes and agitation ex-
posure times. Proteolytic enzymes tested were Accutase
(Cat#07922, STEMCELL Technologies), TrypLE (Cat#
12605028, ThermoFisher), and 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA
(Cat#25300062, ThermoFisher). The bioreactor was
brought under the laminar flow hood where aggregates
settled for 5 min. Media from the bioreactor were aspi-
rated into conical tubes, leaving approximately 3 mL of
aggregate culture in the bioreactor. Conical tubes were
centrifuged at 300g for 5 min. Media from the conical
tubes were discarded, and the remaining cell pellets were
resuspended in 20 mL of proteolytic enzyme with 10 hM
Y-27632 and added back into the bioreactor aggregate
culture. The bioreactor was then placed back in the in-
cubator (37°C, 5% CO.) and agitated at 80 rpm. Every
5 min, for a total of 30 min, the bioreactor was quickly
brought under the laminar flow hood where 200-uL
samples were removed for cell counts and phase-
contrast imaging. Cell counts were performed using the
NucleoCounter NC-200 to obtain a viable cell density

and a percent of cells in aggregates (defined by the in-
strument as a cluster of 5 or more cells). To calculate
the dissociation efficiency at each time point, Eq. 4 was
used:

A
Dissociation Efficiency = BX 100 - cells in aggregates
(4)

where variables A and B are total cell numbers in the
reactor before and after the harvesting procedure. The total
cells in the reactor prior to harvesting were calculated
through Eq. 5:

cell
A= Aves sample count x reactor volume predissociation
m
(5)

where the average sample count was determined
through bioreactor cell samples (1.0 mL) dissociated via
traditionally counting methods described above. The re-
actor volume predissociation was the sum of the media
transferred to conical tubes and the remaining aggregate
culture in the bioreactor (approximately 3 mL). Total
cells in the reactor after the harvesting procedure was
calculated through Eq. 6:

at . wae
B= Ave sample count x reactor volume post dissociation
(6)

where the average sample count was determined from
the 200-uL samples taken directly from the bioreactor
during the harvesting procedure. The reactor volume
post dissociation was the sum of the proteolytic enzyme
volume added to the bioreactor (20mL) and the
remaining aggregate culture in the bioreactor prior to
harvesting (approximately 3 mL).

Karyotyping

Samples of bioreactor-generated aggregates were incu-
bated in 10-mL bioreactors in medium supplemented with
0.1 ug/mL KaryoMax Colcemid (Cat#15212012, Thermo-
Scientific) for 4h. The aggregates were then enzymatically
dissociated as previously described. Single cells were
collected by centrifugation, suspended in 0.075M KCl
hypotonic solution (Cat#P217-500, Fischer Scientific), and
incubated at 37°C for 25 min. Cells were then fixed with
3:1 methanol to acetic acid solution (Cat#A412-4, Fisher
Scientific, Cat#AX0073, EMD), and chromosome prepara-
tions were GTG-banded using standard cytogenetic tech-
niques. Karyograms were analyzed according to the ISCN
standards at ~ 450 band resolution using the Ikaros karyo-
typing system (Metasystems).

morphology (Fig. 6b) in the second passage in the 100-mL
and 500-mL vertical-wheel bioreactors were comparable
to that of the first. Importantly, there was no extended lag
phase present in the second bioreactor passage, indicating
that the aggregates were still within a healthy growth
range and that extended enzyme exposure during the

harvest did not impact serial expansion. When cells
reach oxygen or nutrient limitations before passa-
ging, they exit the exponential growth phase and
enter a plateau or cell death phase. This delay in
subculturing can result in a significant decrease in
cell fold expansion and stem cell differentiation

bioreactors and serially passaged into 0.1-L and 0.5-L vertical-wheel bioreactors (scale bar = 200 [im). ¢ Karyogram analysis of hiPSCs taken from
the final day of the vertical-wheel bioreactor serial passage (day 12). Cell samples were collected from n=4 stirred suspension bioreactors at each
condition. The P values were set at 0.05 and all graphs are presented with a + standard error of the mean (SEM)

potential in the next passage, which was not ob-
served in this case [46-48].

Additional samples were collected at the end of the
12-day culture period to assess genomic stability and to
determine phenotypic and functional pluripotency qual-
ity. Following the 12-day optimized expansion process in
the vertical-wheel bioreactors, the hiPSCs presented with
a normal chromosome complement (Fig. 6c). hiPSC ag-
gregates maintained expression for human pluripotency
markers SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, and Nanog, with confocal
slices displaying no difference in spatial expression be-
tween the outer edge and the center of the aggregates
(Fig. 7a). Directed tri-lineage differentiation into neural
cells, hepatocytes, and cardiomyocytes demonstrated

that the hiPSCs retained full pluripotency after bioreactor
culture, functionally generating cells from the three germ
layers (Fig. 7b). Negative control confocal images are
included in Supplementary Fig. 1. Pluripotency-associated
genes showed either comparable (i.e., Oct-4, Nanog, and
Rex1) or higher (i.e., Sox2 and KIf4) expression in hiPSCs
following serial passaging in bioreactors compared to their
static cultured counterpart (Fig. 8). This corroborates the
maintenance of pluripotency state following several pas-
sages of hiPSCs in vertical-wheel bioreactors.

Discussion
The ability of hiPSCs to mimic traditional hESC self-
renewal capacity and functional pluripotency potential

Aggregate immunocytochemistry

Aggregate samples containing 1E6 cells were removed
from the bioreactor culture and added into microcentri-
fuge tubes (Cat#10011-724, VWR). Aggregates were
rinsed twice with PBS and resuspended in 0.5 mL of fix-
ation buffer (Cat#FC001, R&D Systems) to be incubated
for 1h at room temperature. Aggregate samples were
then rinsed twice with PBS and resuspended in 200-uL
permeabilization buffer (Cat#FC005, R&D Systems) with
1 ug/10° cells antibody stain and 14M/10° cells nuclei
stain and incubated for 3h at room temperature. Conju-
gated antibody stains for SSEA-4 (Cat#FAB1435F, R&D
Systems), TRA-1-60 (Cat# FAB4770P, R&D Systems),
and Nanog (Cat#MABD24A4, Millipore Sigma) were
used along with the nuclei stain To-Pro-3 Iodide Nucleic
Acid Stain (Cat#T3605, Thermo Fisher). Cells were then
rinsed twice with PBS and imaged using a Carl Zeiss
Laser Scanning Microscope 700 with lasers at 488 nm
and 639 nm and corresponding filter sets.

Tri-lineage differentiation

Bioreactor-cultured hiPSC aggregates were differentiated
into cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes, and neural rosettes
using the previously published protocols [42-44]. The
aggregates were collected on day 12 post-inoculation
and were either dissociated into single cells as described
in the “Materials and methods” section or directly plated
as aggregates for in vitro differentiation. For both cardio-
myocyte and hepatocyte differentiation, hiPSCs were
seeded at a density of 2E5 cells/plate on Matrigel-coated
FluoroDish Cell Culture Dish plates (Cat#FD35-100,
World Precision Instrument) containing mTeSR1
supplemented with Y-27632 and cultured to 80-90%
confluency before undergoing differentiation [42, 43].
Mature cardiomyocytes and hepatocytes at day 20 of
differentiation were used for the analysis. For neural
rosette differentiation, hiPSC aggregates were cultured
on poly-L-ornithine (Cat#A-004-C, Sigma Aldrich)-
coated FluoroDish cell culture dish plates in DMEM/
F12 medium supplemented with 5% KnockOut serum
replacement (Cat# 10828010, Thermo Fisher Scientific),
0.1mM_ non-essential amino acids (Cat# 11140050,
Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol
(Cat#21985023, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 1%
penicillin-streptomycin (Cat#15140122, Thermo Fisher
Scientific) for 4 days. Further, the aggregates were
transferred onto Matrigel-coated plates in Neurobasal™
Medium (Cat#21103049, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supple-
mented with B27 without retinoic acid (Cat#12587010,
Thermo Fisher Scientific), N2 supplement (Cat#17502048,
Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.005% bovine serum albumin
(Cat#15260037, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 1mM _ so-
dium pyruvate (Cat#11360-070, Thermo Fisher Scientific)
for an additional 5days before analysis. Differentiated

cardiomyocytes and hepatocytes were analyzed by
whole-mount immunostaining and confocal imaging
using Cardiac Troponin T antibody (Cat#MA5-12960,
5 g/mL, Thermo Fisher Scientific), HNF-4-alpha anti-
body (Cat#ab92378, 1:100, Abcam), and CYP3A4 antibody
(Cat# MA5-17064, 1:200, Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Neural rosettes were analyzed using Pax-6 (Cat# PRB-
278P, 1:100, BioLegend) and Tubulin B 3 (TUBB3)
(Cat#801202, 1 g/mL, BioLegend) antibodies.

RNA isolation and reverse transcription (RT) quantitative
(q) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (RT-qPCR)

hiPSC aggregates were collected on day 6 and day 12
post-inoculation and used for RNA isolation. Total RNA
was extracted using PureLink” RNA Mini Kit
(Cat#12183018A, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to
the manufacturer protocol, followed by DNAse I digestion
using DNAse I Amplification Grade (Cat#18068015,
Thermo Fisher Scientific). Next, 500 ng RNA was used for
cDNA synthesis using Superscript” IV Reverse Transcript-
ase (Cat#18090010, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 50 uM
Oligo (dT)20 Primer (Cat#18418020, Thermo Fisher
Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
To quantitate transcripts, the subsequent RT-qPCR gene
expression analysis was performed on Applied Biosystems
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) using Fast SYBR™ Green Mas-
ter Mix (Cat#4385612, Thermo Fisher Scientific). For each
sample, relative mRNA expression was quantified relative
to the housekeeping gene GAPDH and was normalized to
static cultured hiPSC level (= 1). The relative quantifica-
tion (RQ) was completed based on comparative Cy
(AAC) through the 24°" method. The gene expression
results are shown as relative mRNA expression (RQ) to
static cultured hiPSCs (RQ = 1). At least two technical and
three biological replicates were assayed for all quantitative
RT-PCR reactions. Pluripotency-associated genes, Oct-4,
Sox2, Nanog, KIf4, and Rexl, were used for RT-qPCR.
The primer sequences for SYBR Green probe are listed in
Supplementary Table 1.

Statistics

Statistical analysis was done using GraphPad Prism
(v6.0). A one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett mul-
tiple comparison test was used for all growth curve and
aggregate size comparisons. Cell samples were collected
from n =4 stirred suspension bioreactors at each condi-
tion. The P values were set at 0.05, and all graphs are
presented with a + standard error of the mean (SEM). A
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by
Tukey’s multiple comparison test was used for RT-qPCR
for statistical analysis. The significance was set at P<
0.05 using GraphPad Prism.

in vitro and in vivo make them an ideal cell type for
generating large quantities of differentiated cells needed
for regenerative medicine applications [49]. Epigenetic
reprogramming of hiPSCs from somatic cells provides
the unique opportunity for personalized regenerative
medicine with reduced risks of rejection as well as large-
scale disease modeling studies that would otherwise be
restricted due to limited availability of primary cells and
biopsy material. The transfer of laboratory processes into
a manufacturing facility, however, is one of the most
critical steps required for the production of cell-based
therapies and products and is currently bottlenecked by
a lack of scalable bioprocess protocols for production of
clinical quantities of high-quality hiPSCs [50].

While stirred-tank bioreactors offer several advantages
for stem cell manufacturing, there are major limitations
related to the complex hydrodynamics and high shear

stress at the impeller tip. Traditional stirred-tank biore-
actors employ horizontal-blade or turbine impellers that
require careful optimization at each scale. The shear
stress at the impeller tip increases with reactor scale,
imiting the successful scale-up of shear-sensitive stem
cells [51]. The vertical-wheel bioreactor that was hydro-
dynamically characterized and utilized in this study
could prove to be invaluable to overcoming these
urdles for scale-up of hiPSCs, which are among the
most difficult cell types to cultivate. Unlike mouse cells,
uman pluripotent stem cells differentiate extensively
when cultured as aggregates in stirred suspension biore-
actors [52]. Even compared to traditional hESCs, hiPSCs
display slower growth kinetics and impaired directed dif-
erentiation, making an optimized culture environment

especially important for their successful cultivation [53].

Results

Vertical-wheel bioreactor CFD modeling

To investigate the hydrodynamic environment, the
vertical-wheel bioreactor, geometrically outlined in
Fig. 1a, was modeled at agitation rates between 20 and
100rpm. Figure 1b displays the change in volume
average hydrodynamic variables (velocity, shear stress,
and energy dissipation rate) from when the model was
initiated through 5 s of flow time. Steady state is reached
between 2 and 3s for all tested agitations, evident by the
plateau in measured values. The exception being 100
rpm, where the volume average energy dissipation rate
continues to fluctuate between 3.7E-3 m?/s® and 4.7E-3
m’/s> due to an increase in turbulent energy. Both
volume average velocity and volume average shear stress
increase in a linear fashion with respect to agitation rate.
Conversely, volume average energy dissipation rate in-
creases exponentially with respect to agitation rate. It is
evident from the vertical slices in the bioreactor (Fig. 1c)
that at a lower operating condition, 40rpm, hydro-
dynamic forces within the reactor are very consistent.
The distribution in energy dissipation rate throughout
the reactor height is particularly narrow, with no notice-
able changes within the rotating domain at the given
colorimetric scale. At a higher operating condition, 100
rpm, hydrodynamic forces show an increase in variability
within the reactor volume, with much greater forces
acting around the impeller blades. The difference in
maximum force values, which are often calculated to
keep constant in scale-up, are orders of magnitude
higher than the volume average values. At 100 rpm, for
instance, the maximum energy dissipation rate is 8.9E-1
m?/s® whereas the volume average energy dissipation
rate is 4.2E-3 m?/s®. What is particularly interesting is
the CFD generated flow patterns within the vertical-
wheel bioreactor, shown in Fig. 2. The velocity stream-
lines in the vertical-wheel bioreactor display a lemnis-
cate (figure-eight) profile. Unlike traditional horizontal-
impeller bioreactors, the fluid in the vertical-wheel re-
actor moves throughout the entire liquid width and
height. The fluid streamlines weave between the pitched
wheel blades with increased velocity corresponding to an
increase in agitation.

Single-cell bioreactor inoculation

To first investigate the potential of single-cell inocula-
tion, hiPSCs were seeded into 100-mL working volume
horizontal-blade and vertical-wheel bioreactors operated
at 40rpm, 60rpm, and 80rpm for 6days of batch
culture. As is evident from the growth curve and fold-
expansion data (Fig. 3a), single-cell inoculation of
hiPSCs in the vertical-wheel reactor was quite successful,
reaching a maximum expansion of 16.7 + 1.1-fold at 40
rpm. In contrast, fold expansion in the horizontal-blade

Page 7 of 19

bioreactor was minimal, reaching a maximum of 6.3 +
2.7-fold at 80rpm. The reduced cell yield in the
orizontal-blade reactor is likely linked to poor mixing
that results in large, heterogeneous aggregates pictured
in Fig. 3b. The aggregate distribution graphs for the
orizontal-blade reactor (Fig. 3c) acquire either bi-model
eaks or large, flat distributed averages, indicative of un-
ealthy aggregate morphology. By day 5 of culture,
iPSC aggregates in the horizontal-blade reactors
reached over 400 um in diameter. Beyond this aggregate
size threshold, necrosis is expected to occur with low
levels of oxygen and nutrients diffusing into the center
of the aggregate, resulting in heterogeneity in cell growth
and differentiation potential [45]. hiPSCs cultured in the
vertical-wheel bioreactors maintained consistent aggre-
gate sizes with a single, narrow peak distribution at all
tested agitation rates. Day 5 average aggregate sizes in
the vertical-wheel reactor seeded with single cells
remained below the threshold aggregate size, ranging
between 169.44m+5.5um and 275.45 um+6.9 um in
diameter at 80 rpm and 40 rpm respectively.

Next, pre-formed aggregate inoculation and single-cell
inoculation methods were compared in the vertical-
wheel bioreactors. Under batch culture conditions, there
were no differences in growth at corresponding agitation
rates (Fig. 4a), with aggregate morphology remaining
consistent between inoculation methods (Fig. 4b). At the
tested agitation rates and inoculation methods, the cells
experienced a lag phase on day 1 and entered the
exponential growth phase on day 2 of culture. Batch and
fed-batch single-cell inoculation in the vertical-wheel
bioreactors was then compared (Fig. 4a’). At all tested
agitation rates, fed-batch culture resulted in maximum
fold expansions that were approximately twice that of
batch culture conditions (Fig. 4c). Final cell concentra-
tions at 40 rpm were significantly higher than those at
60rpm and 80rpm, with a maximum expansion of
32.3 + 3.2-fold reached on day 6 of fed-batch culture.
While there were significant differences in average
aggregate size between the tested agitation rates, with
average aggregate size decreasing in correspondence to
an increase in agitation rate, average aggregate size
within each agitation rate seeded as pre-formed or single
cells remained the same (Fig. 4d).

Bioreactor harvesting

An optimized in-vessel harvesting protocol was devel-
oped by studying the effects of enzyme type and agita-
tion exposure time on the dissociation efficiency and
percentage of cells in aggregates. Accutase, TrypLE, and
0.05% Trypsin-EDTA were tested at exposure times of 5,
10, 15, 20, 25, and 30min. A large reduction in the
percent of aggregates occurred between 5 and 10min
for all tested enzymes (Fig. 5a). A further decrease in the

bioreactors highlighted differences in hydrodynamics
between the vertical planes in the reactor [33, 54]. Above
and below the impeller blade were areas with relatively
low hydrodynamic values and fluid dead
Conversely, the middle section of the working volume
height experienced relatively high hydrodynamic forces.
If aggregates in the horizontal-blade reactor flow in a
mostly radial fashion along with the fluid, they will
become trapped in either a high shear zone (small aggre-
gates) or a low shear zone (large aggregates). Single-cell
hiPSC inoculation was successful in the vertical-wheel
bioreactors, producing a narrow distribution of aggre-
gate sizes at each agitation rate with high cell fold
expansions, particularly at 40rpm. With a fed-batch
feeding strategy employed, over 30-fold expansion in 6
days was achieved, which is significantly higher than
other published studies which inoculate hiPSCs in bioreac-
tors using cell clumps or single cells at high cell densities
(2 x 10°-1 x 10° cells/mL). Early publications achieve a
maximum of 6-fold expansion in 4 to 7 days [15], while re-
cent publications achieve a maximum of 10-fold expansion
in 12 days [55] and 10- to 16-fold expansion in 7 days [56].
Literature has indeed provided evidence that hiPSCs har-
vested as single cells are more likely to acquire genetic ab-
normalities [57]. Conventional methods used to subculture
hiPSCs include manual scraping and microdissection as
well as enzymatic and non-enzymatic procedures to detach
cell clumps from their matrix. Manual methods to select
colonies are labor intensive and highly dependent on the
proficiency of skilled technical personal, making them
infeasible for a manufacturing setting [58]. Passaging of cell
clumps lacks standardization in counting and measuring
clump sizes, making it impractical for large-scale, reprodu-
cible results [50]. Clump sizes are difficult to control result-
ing in increased heterogeneity in the seeding population
(11, 24]. The precise number and spatial coordination of
various cell-cell interactions involved in aggregate growth
and embryoid body formation influences cell quality and
the course of cell differentiation, making a controlled aggre-
gate population an essential consideration [59, 60]. While
others have shown that under certain culture conditions
single-cell inoculated hiPSC maintenance of pluripotency
and karyotype stability is possible [61, 62], to the best of
our knowledge, current publications have not investigated
bioreactor harvesting of hiPSC aggregates dissociated into
single cells for serial passaging. Bioreactor harvesting is an
essential step in manufacturing scale-up of stem cell culture
but is rarely investigated. The authors were successful in
designing a full reactor harvest protocol for the dissociation
of hiPSC aggregates into single cells. This involved finding
an appropriate enzyme, exposure time, reduced working
volume, and agitation rate within the reactor to dissociate
aggregates into single cells without sacrificing the cells abil-
ity to recover in growth and maintain pluripotent quality

zones.

characteristics. Recently, bioprocess publications have in-
vestigated bioreactor harvesting of mesenchymal stromal
cells grown on microcarriers [63-66]. These studies opti-
mized protocols by testing many of the same variables, but
recovery yields generally hovered around 80%. This reduced
recovery, compared to the 95% achieved in this study, is
ikely attributed to the additional challenges associated with
separating the cells from the microcarriers through a multi-
filtration and washing process.

Importantly, the cells harvested and re-inoculated as
single cells in both 0.1-L and scaled-up 0.5-L vertical-
wheel bioreactors not only maintained consistent growth
kinetics, they maintained a normal karyotype and pluri-
otent function after 12days of bioreactor culture.
While there are a few studies with mouse ESCs cultured
on microcarriers [67-69] or as aggregates [70], there
acks a robust method for serial culturing of human
ESCs in stirred suspension culture. A recent publication
71] demonstrated that hESCs cultured on microcarriers
often lose their stemness through successive passages. In
this study, 3-fold expansion was initially achieved over 5
days; however, with each successive passage, cell expan-
sion was reduced until cells could not be passaged. In
our recent publication [41], we showed that hiPSCs
could be cultured through successive serial passages in
the vertical-wheel bioreactor with expansions ranging
between 30 and 35-fold each passage. While we were
able to show that growth and pluripotency could be
maintained in the bioreactors, the protocol required pre-
formed aggregate inoculation and a cell sample passaging
protocol, limiting our ability to scale-up the process.
Additionally, it was noted that inconsistent lag phases
resulted between passages, such that culture periods
would range between 6 and 8 days. These inconsisten-
cies in passage length are not acceptable in a manu-
facturing setting. By utilizing single-cell inoculation
and the full reactor harvest protocol optimized in this
study, the increased lag phase was not observed in
the serial passage. The hiPSCs generated in the
vertical-wheel reactor maintained high-quality stan-
dards in the generation of morphologically healthy
and homogenous aggregates. The cells maintained a
normal karyotype, an expression of characteristic
pluripotency markers, and the ability to differentiate
into cell types of all three germ layers. It should be
noted that the tri-lineage differentiation performed in
this study was of a qualitative nature. There are nu-
merous bioprocess challenges associated with obtain-
ing high differentiation efficiencies which the authors
hope to address in future studies. The methods opti-
mized in this study for generation of large quantities
of high-quality hiPSCs in the vertical-wheel bioreactor
overcome some of the major bottlenecks in moving
production to the clinical and manufacturing setting.

number of aggregates continued until 20min for all
tested enzymes. After 20 min, the percent of aggregates
remains plateaued, indicating no further dissociation
activity was occurring. When comparing enzyme types,
the percent of aggregates remaining and the dissociation
efficiency at the end of 20 min were considered. The dis-
sociation efficiency at 20 min was calculated by compar-
ing cell sample counts prior to the full reactor harvest
with samples taken during the harvest and factoring in
the percent of cells that remained in aggregates. Of the
tested enzymes, 0.05% Trypsin resulted in the poorest

performance, with a calculated dissociation efficiency of
82.9% + 10.0%. The use of Accutase resulted in the high-
est dissociation efficiency of 95.2% + 4.0% and was there-
fore selected as the optimal enzyme for the in-vessel
harvest protocol (Fig. 5b).

Conclusions

hiPSCs carry enormous promise for breakthroughs in
understanding human development, drug screening,
disease modeling, and cell and gene therapies; however,
their therapeutic potential has been bottlenecked in a la-
boratory setting due to bioprocess challenges in scale-up
of large quantities of high-quality cells. This study
focused on characterizing and optimizing the use of
vertical-wheel bioreactors as a tool to overcome hiPSC
production challenges. The unique bioreactor geometry
provided a low shear stress environment with a more
homogeneous distribution of hydrodynamic forces.
While a single-cell hiPSC inoculation method proved
unsuccessful in traditional horizontal-blade bioreactors,
the vertical-wheel environment supported healthy mor-
phological aggregate growth, high cell fold expansions,
and maintenance of pluripotency cell quality. This study
also includes the first published protocol for in-vessel
hiPSC aggregate harvesting, permitting the entire bio-
reactor volume to be dissociated into single cells for
serial passaging and scale-up. These protocols provide a
feasible solution for the culture of high-quality hiPSCs at
a clinical and manufacturing scale by overcoming some
of the major documented bioprocess bottlenecks.

Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2021) 12:55 Conclusions hiPSCs carry enormous promise for breakthroughs in understanding human development, drug screening, disease modeling, and cell and gene therapies; however, their therapeutic potential has been bottlenecked in a la- boratory setting due to bioprocess challenges in scale-up of large quantities of high-quality cells. This study focused on characterizing and optimizing the use of vertical-wheel bioreactors as a tool to overcome hiPSC production challenges. The unique bioreactor geometry provided a low shear stress environment with a more homogeneous distribution of hydrodynamic forces. While a single-cell hiPSC inoculation method proved unsuccessful in traditional horizontal-blade bioreactors, the vertical-wheel environment supported healthy mor- phological aggregate growth, high cell fold expansions, and maintenance of pluripotency cell quality. This study also includes the first published protocol for in-vessel hiPSC aggregate '}

morphology (Fig. 6b) in the second passage in the 100-mL
and 500-mL vertical-wheel bioreactors were comparable
to that of the first. Importantly, there was no extended lag
phase present in the second bioreactor passage, indicating
that the aggregates were still within a healthy growth
range and that extended enzyme exposure during the

harvest did not impact serial expansion. When cells
reach oxygen or nutrient limitations before passa-
ging, they exit the exponential growth phase and
enter a plateau or cell death phase. This delay in
subculturing can result in a significant decrease in
cell fold expansion and stem cell differentiation

Fig. 6 a Growth kinetics and b representative brightfield microscope images of hiPSCs seeded as single cells cultured in 0.1-L vertical-wheel
bioreactors and serially passaged into 0.1-L and 0.5-L vertical-wheel bioreactors (scale bar = 200 [im). ¢ Karyogram analysis of hiPSCs taken from
the final day of the vertical-wheel bioreactor serial passage (day 12). Cell samples were collected from n=4 stirred suspension bioreactors at each
condition. The P values were set at 0.05 and all graphs are presented with a + standard error of the mean (SEM)

potential in the next passage, which was not ob-
served in this case [46-48].

Additional samples were collected at the end of the
12-day culture period to assess genomic stability and to
determine phenotypic and functional pluripotency qual-
ity. Following the 12-day optimized expansion process in
the vertical-wheel bioreactors, the hiPSCs presented with
a normal chromosome complement (Fig. 6c). hiPSC ag-
gregates maintained expression for human pluripotency
markers SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, and Nanog, with confocal
slices displaying no difference in spatial expression be-
tween the outer edge and the center of the aggregates
(Fig. 7a). Directed tri-lineage differentiation into neural
cells, hepatocytes, and cardiomyocytes demonstrated

that the hiPSCs retained full pluripotency after bioreactor
culture, functionally generating cells from the three germ
layers (Fig. 7b). Negative control confocal images are
included in Supplementary Fig. 1. Pluripotency-associated
genes showed either comparable (i.e., Oct-4, Nanog, and
Rex1) or higher (i.e., Sox2 and KIf4) expression in hiPSCs
following serial passaging in bioreactors compared to their
static cultured counterpart (Fig. 8). This corroborates the
maintenance of pluripotency state following several pas-
sages of hiPSCs in vertical-wheel bioreactors.

Discussion
The ability of hiPSCs to mimic traditional hESC self-
renewal capacity and functional pluripotency potential

in vitro and in vivo make them an ideal cell type for
generating large quantities of differentiated cells needed
for regenerative medicine applications [49]. Epigenetic
reprogramming of hiPSCs from somatic cells provides
the unique opportunity for personalized regenerative
medicine with reduced risks of rejection as well as large-
scale disease modeling studies that would otherwise be
restricted due to limited availability of primary cells and
biopsy material. The transfer of laboratory processes into
a manufacturing facility, however, is one of the most
critical steps required for the production of cell-based
therapies and products and is currently bottlenecked by
a lack of scalable bioprocess protocols for production of
clinical quantities of high-quality hiPSCs [50].

While stirred-tank bioreactors offer several advantages
for stem cell manufacturing, there are major limitations
related to the complex hydrodynamics and high shear

stress at the impeller tip. Traditional stirred-tank biore-
actors employ horizontal-blade or turbine impellers that
require careful optimization at each scale. The shear
stress at the impeller tip increases with reactor scale,
imiting the successful scale-up of shear-sensitive stem
cells [51]. The vertical-wheel bioreactor that was hydro-
dynamically characterized and utilized in this study
could prove to be invaluable to overcoming these
urdles for scale-up of hiPSCs, which are among the
most difficult cell types to cultivate. Unlike mouse cells,
uman pluripotent stem cells differentiate extensively
when cultured as aggregates in stirred suspension biore-
actors [52]. Even compared to traditional hESCs, hiPSCs
display slower growth kinetics and impaired directed dif-
erentiation, making an optimized culture environment

especially important for their successful cultivation [53].

study, the vertical-wheel reactor is unique in its mixing
ability, directing fluid streamlines in a lemniscate pattern
throughout the entire volume of the reactor. This results
in a more uniform distribution of hydrodynamic forces
and a lower shear stress environment, ideal for hiPSC
growth as aggregates. The hydrodynamic distribution of
energy dissipation rate, which scales exponentially with
an increase in agitation, is a controlling variable dictating
average aggregate size and size distributions [54].
Among the lower agitation rates modeled (40 rpm), the
energy dissipation rate remained homogeneous throughout
the vertical-wheel volume, leading the authors to believe

that hiPSC aggregates could be successfully cultured as
single cells in this bioreactor environment.

When single-cell inoculation of hiPSCs was tested in
traditional horizontal-blade bioreactors, the authors
were unsuccessful in generating consistent aggregate
sizes. At all tested agitation rates (40 rpm, 60 rpm, and
80 rpm), aggregate distributions were bi-model or spread
out in nature corresponding to low cell yields. This
could be a result of the predominantly radial mixing
present within the horizontal-blade bioreactor that limits
aggregates from moving throughout the entire volume.

bioreactors highlighted differences in hydrodynamics
between the vertical planes in the reactor [33, 54]. Above
and below the impeller blade were areas with relatively
low hydrodynamic values and fluid dead
Conversely, the middle section of the working volume
height experienced relatively high hydrodynamic forces.
If aggregates in the horizontal-blade reactor flow in a
mostly radial fashion along with the fluid, they will
become trapped in either a high shear zone (small aggre-
gates) or a low shear zone (large aggregates). Single-cell
hiPSC inoculation was successful in the vertical-wheel
bioreactors, producing a narrow distribution of aggre-
gate sizes at each agitation rate with high cell fold
expansions, particularly at 40rpm. With a fed-batch
feeding strategy employed, over 30-fold expansion in 6
days was achieved, which is significantly higher than
other published studies which inoculate hiPSCs in bioreac-
tors using cell clumps or single cells at high cell densities
(2 x 10°-1 x 10° cells/mL). Early publications achieve a
maximum of 6-fold expansion in 4 to 7 days [15], while re-
cent publications achieve a maximum of 10-fold expansion
in 12 days [55] and 10- to 16-fold expansion in 7 days [56].
Literature has indeed provided evidence that hiPSCs har-
vested as single cells are more likely to acquire genetic ab-
normalities [57]. Conventional methods used to subculture
hiPSCs include manual scraping and microdissection as
well as enzymatic and non-enzymatic procedures to detach
cell clumps from their matrix. Manual methods to select
colonies are labor intensive and highly dependent on the
proficiency of skilled technical personal, making them
infeasible for a manufacturing setting [58]. Passaging of cell
clumps lacks standardization in counting and measuring
clump sizes, making it impractical for large-scale, reprodu-
cible results [50]. Clump sizes are difficult to control result-
ing in increased heterogeneity in the seeding population
(11, 24]. The precise number and spatial coordination of
various cell-cell interactions involved in aggregate growth
and embryoid body formation influences cell quality and
the course of cell differentiation, making a controlled aggre-
gate population an essential consideration [59, 60]. While
others have shown that under certain culture conditions
single-cell inoculated hiPSC maintenance of pluripotency
and karyotype stability is possible [61, 62], to the best of
our knowledge, current publications have not investigated
bioreactor harvesting of hiPSC aggregates dissociated into
single cells for serial passaging. Bioreactor harvesting is an
essential step in manufacturing scale-up of stem cell culture
but is rarely investigated. The authors were successful in
designing a full reactor harvest protocol for the dissociation
of hiPSC aggregates into single cells. This involved finding
an appropriate enzyme, exposure time, reduced working
volume, and agitation rate within the reactor to dissociate
aggregates into single cells without sacrificing the cells abil-
ity to recover in growth and maintain pluripotent quality

zones.

characteristics. Recently, bioprocess publications have in-
vestigated bioreactor harvesting of mesenchymal stromal
cells grown on microcarriers [63-66]. These studies opti-
mized protocols by testing many of the same variables, but
recovery yields generally hovered around 80%. This reduced
recovery, compared to the 95% achieved in this study, is
ikely attributed to the additional challenges associated with
separating the cells from the microcarriers through a multi-
filtration and washing process.

Importantly, the cells harvested and re-inoculated as
single cells in both 0.1-L and scaled-up 0.5-L vertical-
wheel bioreactors not only maintained consistent growth
kinetics, they maintained a normal karyotype and pluri-
otent function after 12days of bioreactor culture.
While there are a few studies with mouse ESCs cultured
on microcarriers [67-69] or as aggregates [70], there
acks a robust method for serial culturing of human
ESCs in stirred suspension culture. A recent publication
71] demonstrated that hESCs cultured on microcarriers
often lose their stemness through successive passages. In
this study, 3-fold expansion was initially achieved over 5
days; however, with each successive passage, cell expan-
sion was reduced until cells could not be passaged. In
our recent publication [41], we showed that hiPSCs
could be cultured through successive serial passages in
the vertical-wheel bioreactor with expansions ranging
between 30 and 35-fold each passage. While we were
able to show that growth and pluripotency could be
maintained in the bioreactors, the protocol required pre-
formed aggregate inoculation and a cell sample passaging
protocol, limiting our ability to scale-up the process.
Additionally, it was noted that inconsistent lag phases
resulted between passages, such that culture periods
would range between 6 and 8 days. These inconsisten-
cies in passage length are not acceptable in a manu-
facturing setting. By utilizing single-cell inoculation
and the full reactor harvest protocol optimized in this
study, the increased lag phase was not observed in
the serial passage. The hiPSCs generated in the
vertical-wheel reactor maintained high-quality stan-
dards in the generation of morphologically healthy
and homogenous aggregates. The cells maintained a
normal karyotype, an expression of characteristic
pluripotency markers, and the ability to differentiate
into cell types of all three germ layers. It should be
noted that the tri-lineage differentiation performed in
this study was of a qualitative nature. There are nu-
merous bioprocess challenges associated with obtain-
ing high differentiation efficiencies which the authors
hope to address in future studies. The methods opti-
mized in this study for generation of large quantities
of high-quality hiPSCs in the vertical-wheel bioreactor
overcome some of the major bottlenecks in moving
production to the clinical and manufacturing setting.

Conclusions

hiPSCs carry enormous promise for breakthroughs in
understanding human development, drug screening,
disease modeling, and cell and gene therapies; however,
their therapeutic potential has been bottlenecked in a la-
boratory setting due to bioprocess challenges in scale-up
of large quantities of high-quality cells. This study
focused on characterizing and optimizing the use of
vertical-wheel bioreactors as a tool to overcome hiPSC
production challenges. The unique bioreactor geometry
provided a low shear stress environment with a more
homogeneous distribution of hydrodynamic forces.
While a single-cell hiPSC inoculation method proved
unsuccessful in traditional horizontal-blade bioreactors,
the vertical-wheel environment supported healthy mor-
phological aggregate growth, high cell fold expansions,
and maintenance of pluripotency cell quality. This study
also includes the first published protocol for in-vessel
hiPSC aggregate harvesting, permitting the entire bio-
reactor volume to be dissociated into single cells for
serial passaging and scale-up. These protocols provide a
feasible solution for the culture of high-quality hiPSCs at
a clinical and manufacturing scale by overcoming some
of the major documented bioprocess bottlenecks.

Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2021) 12:55 Conclusions hiPSCs carry enormous promise for breakthroughs in understanding human development, drug screening, disease modeling, and cell and gene therapies; however, their therapeutic potential has been bottlenecked in a la- boratory setting due to bioprocess challenges in scale-up of large quantities of high-quality cells. This study focused on characterizing and optimizing the use of vertical-wheel bioreactors as a tool to overcome hiPSC production challenges. The unique bioreactor geometry provided a low shear stress environment with a more homogeneous distribution of hydrodynamic forces.

Abstract

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Preoperative expectations influence postoperative outcomes.
Patients with lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis have especially high expectations of pain relief
and overall functional well-being compared to patients with lumbar stenosis.

PURPOSE: The primary objective was to analyze preoperative expectations of lumbar DS patients
with respect to the type of surgery proposed (decompression vs decompression and fusion). Sec-
ondarily, we aimed to assess the associations between preoperative expectations and patient and
clinical factors as well as postoperative expectations fulfillment.

STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Patients were prospectively enrolled in a multicenter, prospective
cohort study evaluating the assessment and management of degenerative spondylolisthesis utilizing
the infrastructure of the Canadian Spine Outcomes and Research Network (CSORN) surgical
registry.

PATIENT SAMPLE: Patients with a diagnosis of degenerative spondylolisthesis with symptoms
of neurogenic claudication or radiculopathy with or without back pain, unresponsive to nonopera-
tive management over at least 3 months were included. Patients who underwent decompression,

FDA device/drug status: Not applicable.

decompression and posterolateral fusion or decompression and interbody fusion at Canadian spine
centers between January 2015 and September 2021 were included.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The North American Spine Society Lumbar Spine Questionnaire was
utilized for expectations measurement. The expectation questionnaire was completed following
consent and before surgery and at | year.
METHODS: Expectations for pain relief and improvements in overall functional well-being were
rated on a scale of 0 to 100. Preoperative expectation in terms of pain relief and functional well-being
score were calculated. Multivariate linear regression was used to evaluate the association between
expected preoperative patient factors and pain relief and functional well-being. The factors associated
with the most important expectation were evaluated using multivariable multinomial logistic regression.
RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-two patients were included with 100 patients undergoing decom-
pression and 252 patients also undergoing fusion. The seven items of preoperative expectations did
not differ between the procedure groups nor did expected change. The mean pain relief and overall
functional well-being expectation scores did not significantly differ between procedures.

Higher expectations were associated with having more comorbidities [B=-2.0 (SE 0.8), p=.020],
being physically active [B=8.4 (SE 3.2), p=.010] and having more leg pain [f=1.6 (SE 0.7),

p=.015]. Better perceived physical health measured by SF12 PCS was associated with lower expec-
tation of pain relief [B= -0.4 (SE 0.2), p=.039] and functional well-being [B=-0.84 (SE 0.2),
p=.001]. Better perceived mental health measured by SF12 MCS was associated with lower expec-

tation of functional well-being [6=-0.8 (SE 0.2), p=.001].
Postoperative expectations fulfillment did not differ between procedures.

CONCLUSION: Preoperative expectations in terms of pain relief and functional well-being were
similar between the two most common procedures performed, decompression + fusion. Secondar-
ily, higher preoperative expectations were associated with greater pain, disability and being physi-
cally active. Expectations fulfillment did not differ between procedures. © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All

Introduction

It is widely recognized that health care quality assess-
ment requires a wide range of perspectives, including those
of patients. In recent years, patient satisfaction and self-
reported outcomes have increasingly become the focus of
measuring the quality of spinal care [1]. Importantly, it has
been shown that preoperative expectations influence post-
operative patient reported outcomes, functional outcomes,
satisfaction, and adherence to prescribed regimens |2—9]. It
has been suggested that the perception of an experience and
its related degree of satisfaction are a function of preexist-
ing expectations [2]. Also, in a systematic review on the
impact of preoperative expectations in spinal surgery, it
was found that patient expectations frequently exceed
actual outcomes, often creating a discrepancy [2]. Under-
standing patient expectations is therefore critical for sur-
geons, given its impact on outcome.

Patients typically make the decision to undergo spine sur-
gical treatment based on their expectations of relief from
pain and other detrimental symptoms, improving their func-
tion and, consequently improving their quality of life [10].
Patients undergoing spine surgery generally have high
expectations and it has been reported that patients undergo-
ing surgery for thoracolumbar pathology have higher
expectations than those with cervical pathology [11,12].
Furthermore, Canizares et al. reported that patients with
degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) have higher

preoperative expectations of pain relief and overall func-
tional well-being when compared to patients with lumbar
stenosis [11]. However, given that patients with DS can be
offered surgical management with either decompression
plus fusion or decompression alone, and these two proce-
dures are quite different in terms of surgical extent and post-
operative morbidity, it is important to determine if patient
expectations differ between these two offered procedures.

There is little information on how expectations vary
depending on local practices and population. Further,
expectations have been shown to be influenced by multiple
patient and clinical factors [13—15]. Also, one could make
the assumption that surgeons in different centers may vary
in what they tell patients about the outcome of a surgical
procedure. Thus, the hypothesis that patient factors or dif-
ferent centers would impact expectations was the alterna-
tive hypothesis of this study.

Improved understanding of patients’ preoperative and
postoperative expectations is valuable given that surgeons’
handling of such expectations may help to improve postop-
erative patient-reported outcomes by better aligning patient
expectations with reported outcomes in the literature. This
new knowledge will have important implications in patient
education, informed decision-making and assessing the
results of comparative clinical trials.

The primary objective of this study was to analyze the
preoperative expectations of DS patients with respect to the

Patients typically make the decision to undergo spine sur- gical treatment based on their expectations of relief from pain and other detrimental symptoms, improving their func- tion and, consequently improving their quality of life [10]. Patients undergoing spine surgery generally have high expectations and it has been reported that patients undergo- ing surgery for thoracolumbar pathology have higher expectations than those with cervical pathology [11,12]. Furthermore, Canizares et al. reported that patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) have higher preoperative expectations of pain relief and overall func- tional well-being when compared '}

However, given that patients with DS can be offered surgical management with either decompression plus fusion or decompression alone, and these two proce- dures are quite different in terms of surgical extent and post- operative morbidity, it is important to determine if patient expectations differ between these two offered procedures. There is little information on how expectations vary depending on local practices and population. Further, expectations have been shown to be influenced by multiple patient and clinical factors [13—15]. Also, one could make the assumption that surgeons in different centers may vary in what they tell patients about the outcome of a surgical procedure. Thus, the hypothesis that patient factors or dif- ferent centers would impact expectations was the alterna- tive hypothesis of this study. Improved understanding of patients’ preoperative and postoperative expectations is valuable given that surgeons’ handling of such expectations '}

type of surgery proposed (decompression + fusion). Sec-
ondarily, we aimed to assess the associations between pre-
operative expectations and patient and clinical factors in
patients undergoing surgery for lumbar DS. Lastly, we
aimed to compare postoperative fulfillment of expectations
between types of surgery.

Methods

Data source

Patients were prospectively enrolled in a multicenter, pro-
spective cohort study evaluating the assessment and manage-
ment of degenerative spondylolisthesis utilizing the
infrastructure of the Canadian Spine Outcomes and Research
Network (CSORN) surgical registry. Patients included in
this study were not included in previous retrospective studies
from using the CSORN registry. At all sites, standardized
data collection is performed in the preoperative and postop-
erative periods at pre-specified time points. Preoperatively,
and at time of consent, participants completed a question-
naire collecting expectations, sociodemographic, lifestyle,
and clinical information. Postoperatively, at 1 year, patients
completed a questionnaire assessing if surgery fulfilled their
expectations. Local research ethics board approvals were
obtained prior to data collection and all participants provided
written informed consented to participate in the registry.

Patient population

Patients with a diagnosis of degenerative spondylolisthe-
sis with symptoms of neurogenic claudication or radiculop-
athy with or without back pain, unresponsive to
nonoperative management over at least 3 months who
underwent decompression, decompression and posterolat-
eral fusion or decompression and interbody fusion at Cana-
dian spine centers between January 2015 and September
2021 were included. The surgical decision between techni-
ques was at the discretion of the treating surgeon. Patient’s
with worker’s compensation were included. For inclusion
into this analysis, a site had to enroll over 100 patients in
the prospective study and registry. At the time of the pre-
sented analysis not all patients had received surgery
explaining that some sites have less than 100 patients
included in the presented analysis. Patients with greater
than 10 degrees of scoliosis, tumors, isthmic spondylolis-
thesis, more than two level fusion, spinal fracture, concomi-
tant cervical or thoracic myelopathy, had previous lumbar
fusion procedures or concomitant hip and/or knee osteoar-
thritis were excluded from the analysis. Patients were also
excluded if no preoperative questionnaire was completed.

Measurement of expectations of spine surgery

The North American Spine Society Lumbar Spine Ques-
tionnaire was utilized for expectations measurement | 16].
The questionnaire was completed following consent and

before surgery. Patients were asked to answer the following
question prior to their surgery: “What changes would you
expect (not hope) to experience as a result of an operation?”
in relation to seven separate items: leg pain, back pain,
independence in everyday activities, sporting activities/
recreation, general physical capacity: at work and home,
frequency and quality of social contacts, and mental well-
being. Patients were asked to report the magnitude of
change they expected to experience as a result of the sur-
gery: 0 (no change), 1 (somewhat better), 2 (better) or 3
(much better). In relation to the seven items, patients were
asked: “What would be the SINGLE most important change
occurring as a result of an operation that would make you
say the operation helped and was a success?.” Postopera-
tively at 1-year, patients indicated if their expectations were
fulfilled: completely fulfilled, somewhat fulfilled, not at all,
unknown or I don’t know. Patients were also asked: “What
is the single most important change that has occurred as a
result of this surgery that would make you say, the surgery
helped and was a success?” Similar to Rampersaud et al.”?
overall fulfillment was categorized as all expectations were
met, most important expectation was met, most important
expectation was not met, and none were met.

Covariates

Patient factors included were age, sex, educational level
(high school or less vs. college/university), working status
(currently working, in labor force but not currently work-
ing, not in labor force), marital status (married or with part-
ner vs. single/widow/divorced), living arrangement (living
alone vs. living with others, participation in physical activ-
ity (active vs. inactive), smoking status (current smokers
vs. not current smokers), and body mass index. Health sta-
tus factors included the number of comorbidities.

Preoperative patient reported outcomes (PROs) included
the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and numerical rating
scale (NRS) back and NRS leg [17,18]. The Patient Health
Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-8) was collected with
scores ranging from 0 to 24 and higher values representing
more severe symptoms of depression [19]. Disability was
recorded with the ODI with scores ranging from 0 to 100
(higher values correspond to greater disability). Patients
reported their level of leg pain and back pain on 0 to 10 on
the NRS with a higher score indication worse pain. Primary
presenting complaint was categorized as back pain, neuro-
genic claudication, radiculopathy or unknown. SF-12 physical
component score (PCS) and mental component score (MCS)
were collected [20]. Symptom duration at baseline was cate-
gorized as less than 2 years versus over 2 years. Radiographic
characteristics were collected in terms of grade of spondylo-
listhesis, number of levels with listhesis and operative level.

Statistical analysis

Demographic and clinical factors were described with
means and standard deviations for continuous variables

and were compared between decompression and fusion
groups using Student’s ¢ test or Mann-Whitney U test. Cat-
egorical variables were reported as frequencies and per-
centages and were compared using Fisher exact test or
Chi-square test.

Patients reported the changes they expected to experi-
ence as a result of the surgery as 0 (no change), 1 (some-
what better), 2 (better) or 3 (much better). Missing scores
or “I don’t know” were excluded from the preoperative
analysis. We calculated the two expectation scores; pain
relief and functional well-being, as described by Canizares
et al. 2020'!. Preoperative expectation in terms of pain
relief score was calculated by summing points for expected
change in leg pain and back pain divided by the total possi-
ble maximum score. Preoperative expectation in terms of
functional well-being was calculated by summing points for
independence in everyday activities, sporting activities/
recreation, general physical capacity, frequency and quality
of social contacts, and mental-well-being divided by the
total possible maximum score. The scores were then
expressed as percentages (0—100), with higher scores
reflecting higher preoperative expectations.

Multivariate linear regression was used to evaluate the
association between expected preoperative patient factors
and pain relief and functional well-being. The factors asso-
ciated with the most important expectation were evaluated
using multivariable multinomial logistic regression.

Baseline characteristics of patients with missing expec-
tation data were compared to those that had complete
expectation data using Student’s f test or Chi-square test as
appropriate. Missing data were not imputed, and analysis
was performed by complete case analysis. All analyses
were performed with SPSS software version 27. A p value
of less than .05 was considered to indicate statistical signifi-
cance.

Results

Preoperative Expectations by procedure type:
decompression + fusion

Patient and clinical characteristics by procedure type are
reported in Table 1. Three hundred fifty-two patients were
included with patients enrolled at four sites by twelve sur-
geons across Canada. One hundred patients underwent
decompression, 252 patients also underwent fusion. Each
surgeon enrolled for both procedures except one surgeon
who enrolled patients only the fusion group. The total num-
ber of patients enrolled per surgeon ranged from three to
101 patients and ranged from one to 76 per procedure type.
Patients who underwent decompression alone were older
[69.6 (SD 10.0) vs. 62.3 (SD 8.9) p=.001], were more com-
monly working (32.0% vs. 19.9% p=.034) and were more
commonly exercising (57.3% vs. 43.6%, p=.030). The
fusion group had a higher proportion of female patients
(67.5% vs. 45.0% p=.001). One patient was on worker’s

compensation in the decompression (1.0%) versus nine
patients in the fusion group (3.6%; p=.293). In the decom-
pression group, patients had lower mean PQH9 [6.2 (SD
4.8) vs. 8.9 (SD 6.1), p=.001], lower mean ODI [40.2 (SD
15.4) vs. 46.4 (15.1), p=.001], lower mean leg pain score
[6.8 (SD 2.7) vs. 7.6 (2.1), p=.004], lower back pain score
[6.3 (SD 2.5) vs. 7.2 (SD 2.0), p=.001], higher mean SF12
PCS [51.0 (SD 10.4) vs. 45.5 (SD 11.6), p=.003] and higher
SF12 MCS [31.4 (SD 9.8) vs. 28.3 (SD8.5), p=.001]. In the
fusion group, more patients had a duration of symptoms
over 2 years (66.7% vs. 54.7%, p=.046). The decompres-
sion group had a higher proportion of spondylolisthesis
grade 1 (91.8% vs. 67.5%, p=.001).

The seven items of preoperative expectations are repre-
sented in Fig. |. Most patients had relatively high expecta-
tions across all items in both procedures. All expectations
items did not differ between the procedure groups (p>.05
for all comparisons). Most patients expected to be better or
much better postoperatively in all dimensions.

Most important expected change is represented in Fig. 2.
Most important expected change did not differ between the
procedure groups (p=.306). Both groups ranked leg pain
first as most important expected change. For the fusion
group, the subsequent order was: back pain, general physi-
cal capacity, independence in everyday activities, sporting
activities/recreation, mental well-being and, lastly, fre-
quency/quality of social contacts. For the decompression
group, the subsequent order was: independence in everyday
activities, general physical capacity, back pain, sporting
activities/recreation, and lastly, mental well-being and fre-
quency/quality of social contacts. Rankings of the most
important expected change were similar across sociodemo-
graphic, lifestyle, health status, and clinical variables exam-
ined. The mean pain relief expectation score did not
significantly differ between procedures [82.1 (SD 20.6) vs.
78.0 (SD 22.6), p=.118]. The mean overall functional well-
being expectation score did not significantly differ between
both procedures [75.7 (SD 20.7) vs. 74.9 (SD 24.5),
p=.789].

Preoperative expectations by patient demographic and
clinical factors

The association between preoperative expectation in
terms of pain relief and functional well-being with patient
and clinical factors is shown via multivariate linear regres-
sion in Table 2. Site two had higher expectation of pain
relief than site 1 [B=9.9 (SE 4.5), p=.030]. More comorbid-
ities were associated with a lower expectation of functional
well-being [f=-2.0 (SE 0.8), p=.020]. Being physically
active was associated with a higher expectation of func-
tional well-being [6=8.4 (SE 3.2), p=.010]. Having more
leg pain was associated with higher expectation of pain
relief [B=1.6 (SE 0.7), p=.015]. Better perceived physical

there was a trend toward more patients having their most

expectations according to surgical procedure type as well as
patient and clinical factors among patients with lumbar DS.
This study provides valuable insight into outcome expecta-
tions in the two main dimensions of expected pain relief
and expected improvement in functional well-being as well
as most important expectation in a patient population with a
uniquely high expectations profile. The main finding of this
study is that preoperative expectations and postoperative
expectations fulfillment are similar between the two most
common surgical procedures performed for lumbar DS
(decompression + fusion). Secondarily, higher preoperative
expectations were associated with greater pain, poor health
and being physically active in the lumbar DS population.
Glennie et al. [12] reported in a retrospective study that
patients with DS identified relief of back pain (31.1%) as
the most important improvement followed by relief of leg

pain (29.5%). Of note, patients included in this study were
not included in previous retrospective studies from using
the CSORN registry. In contrast, in our prospective study,
leg pain was the most important expected change for both
groups. The decompression group reported more commonly
leg pain as most important expected change compared to
fusion group, but this did not reach statistical significance
(32.2% vs. 25.0%). The second most important change was
independence in everyday activities for the decompression
group. For the fusion group, the second most important
change was back pain. This may be explained by the fusion
group having worse baseline back pain and also expected
this predominant symptom to be improved with surgery.
Additionally, surgeons likely inform their patient that back
pain is less likely to improve following a decompression
only procedure. Glennie et al. found that in patients

* Previous surgery = cervical or thoracic or remote lumbar discectomy or laminectomy

undergoing spine surgery overall, fusion (vs. nonfusion) did
not have an influence on the expectation of pain relief over-
all (back/neck and arm/leg pain). Similarly, our study fur-
ther delved into this and showed that preoperative
expectations in terms of overall pain relief, combining back
and leg pain, were similar between surgery type.

Individual characteristics have been shown to influence
the preference for spine surgery [21—25]. In our study,
worse health and greater pain was associated with higher
expectations, which is in accordance to other studies
[11,14,15,26—28]. Specifically, having more comorbidities,
worse leg pain as well as worse perceived mental and physi-
cal health were associated with higher preoperative expect-
ations. However, in contrast, being physically active was
associated with higher expectations of improvement in
functional well-being. This association was not found in a
study including patients undergoing elective surgery for all
degenerative spinal conditions [11]. Therefore, this may be
specific to the lumbar DS population. This highlights that a
patient with a past higher level of functioning will expect

that the surgery will allow a return to a similar higher level
of functioning postoperatively, which may not always be
possible. This is valuable information to surgeons as this
identifies a subgroup of patients with potentially unrealistic
expectations, which may negatively influence outcomes.
Mannon et al. has shown that in patient undergoing lumbar
decompression surgery, between 40% and 50% of patients
had overly optimistic expectations [29].

A Cochrane review suggested fairly strong evidence that
patient-centered consultation processes show improvement
in outcomes [1]. Additionally, training health care providers
in patient-centered approaches positively impacted patient
satisfaction with their care. The importance of discussing
surgical indication and what symptoms are most likely to
improve with surgery has been reported in the literature
[30]. In this present study, the majority of patients reported
that surgery fulfilled their expectations. The overall fulfill-
ment of expectations did not differ between the two proce-
dures. Interestingly, the available literature reports that

Specifically, having more comorbidities, worse leg pain as well as worse perceived mental and physi- cal health were associated with higher preoperative expect- ations. However, in contrast, being physically active was associated with higher expectations of improvement in functional well-being. This association was not found in a study including patients undergoing elective surgery for all degenerative spinal conditions [11]. Therefore, this may be specific to the lumbar DS population. This highlights that a patient with a past higher level of functioning will expect that the surgery will allow a return to a similar higher level of functioning postoperatively, which may not always be possible.

to report satisfaction regardless of the magnitude of symp-
toms change [29]. As most surgery for lumbar DS are per-
formed for quality of life indications, this should
incentivize surgeons to educate patients and themselves
preoperatively to ensure that a realistic appraisal of the
probable outcome from a surgical intervention is shared
between patient and surgeon.

The understanding of the variability of preoperative
expectations presented in this report can be used toward
improving the consent process In a survey of 428 patients,
when asked about how patients came to have their expecta-
tions, 83% of patients stated that their surgeon was the most
important source [31]. Therefore, preoperative expectations
can be modified through enhanced communication. Addi-
tionally, by exploring patient expectations of the offered
surgery, it may inform surgeons as for whom surgery
should be most appropriate. It will help identify patients

who are likely to be dissatisfied with surgery by virtue of
their expectations not being adequately met. We suggest
that a thorough calibration of a patient’s perception of suc-
cess and failure and establishing appropriate expectations
become an integral part of the informed consent.

This study provides valuable insight into the preopera-
tive expectations of a patient population with lumbar
pathology commonly treated by most spinal surgeons.
There are, however, limitations that should be considered in
the interpretation of these findings. There are some limita-
tions in terms of the data available as part of the question-
naires in the CSORN database. Older patients were less
likely to have complete expectation data available suggest-
ing selection bias. However, the large size of the database
and the high response rate from Spine Surgeon members
provide a good portrait of the Canadian population. Patients
were enrolled from tertiary or quaternary care spine centers

and expectations may differ from patients in other settings.
In this study, four sites were included with over 100 partici-
pants enrolled per site with other sites excluded due to low
enrolment rates. However, the generalizability of the results
likely remains high given the equal regional and care center
representation across Canada by the four included sites. An
analysis to assess the influence of surgeon on postoperative
expectation was not possible due to small number error.
Future studies could perform more granular analysis to
assess the influence of provider or local practices on
patient’s expectations. The limitations of patient-reported
tools must be considered. Patients may not be in a physical
or psychological state to give accurate opinions of their
experience of health status at the time of data collection.
Patients may also be concerned about the negative impact
of their answers on the care given by health care providers
and adjust their responses accordingly. However, data was
collected using the NASS lumbar Spine Outcome Assess-
ment tool, which is widely used, validated and reliable. The
forms were explained in detail by research assistants at all
sites to ensure correct utilization. Future studies should
identify the impact of patient factors on preoperative
expectations of functional well-being. Subsequently, focus
could be directed to identifying interventions that influence
patient expectations and improve the expertise of treating
surgeons in managing preoperative expectations.

Conclusion

This is the first study that specifically assesses variations
in preoperative expectations of surgery for patients with
lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis in terms of expected
pain relief, improvement in functional well-being and most

important expectation. Preoperative expectations were sim-
ilar between the two most common procedures offered,
decompression + fusion. Secondarily, higher preoperative
expectations were associated with greater pain, worse
health and being physically active. Expectations fulfillment
did not differ between procedures. Future studies could
explore specific interventions aimed at managing preopera-
tive expectations and its impact on postoperative outcomes.

In this study, four sites were included with over 100 partici- pants enrolled per site with other sites excluded due to low enrolment rates. However, the generalizability of the results likely remains high given the equal regional and care center representation across Canada by the four included sites. An analysis to assess the influence of surgeon on postoperative expectation was not possible due to small number error. Future studies could perform more granular analysis to assess the influence of provider or local practices on patient’s expectations. The limitations of patient-reported tools must be considered. Patients may not be in a physical or psychological state to give accurate opinions of their experience of health status at the time of data collection. Patients may also be concerned about the negative impact of their answers on the care given by health care providers and adjust their responses accordingly.

The mean pain relief expectation score did not significantly differ between procedures [82.1 (SD 20.6) vs. 78.0 (SD 22.6), p=.118]. The mean overall functional well- being expectation score did not significantly differ between both procedures [75.7 (SD 20.7) '}]}}}

Consider the following example. If we run Dijkstra’s algorithm with starting vertex s, the resulting distance computed for vertices a, b, and c are 3, 2, 12 respectively. The correct shortest path weights should be 3, 1, 11 instead. 2. The MST in the following example uses all edges except the one with weight 2. The shortest path tree in the example has to use the edge with weight 2. Problem 2. Build a graph G’ using the same vertex set V and the same edge set E with new weights w’. The weight of an edge (u,v) € G’ is defined as w'(u,v) = — log w(u, v). Since w(u, v) is between 0 and 1, w’(u,v) must be greater than or equal to 0. Run Dijkstra’s algorithm on G’ to find the shortest path from s to t. Note that choosing the path that minimizes 7.-p w'(e) = — log ([]-<p w(e)) is equivalent to choosing the path that maximizes [],-pw(e). Therefore, the shortest path from s to t in G’ is the path from s to t with the maximum survival "}, {'path': '4b713af3-8cf7-4cd6-bfd2-871dc02ac33e/HW5.pdf', 'text': 'minimum number of people to talk to so that everyone will know the news.

An analysis to assess the influence of surgeon on postoperative expectation was not possible due to small number error. Future studies could perform more granular analysis to assess the influence of provider or local practices on patient’s expectations. The limitations of patient-reported tools must be considered. Patients may not be in a physical or psychological state to give accurate opinions of their experience of health status at the time of data collection. Patients may also be concerned about the negative impact of their answers on the care given by health care providers and adjust their responses accordingly.

page 1: Homework 6a. Due 11:5 9pm Fri Mar 17, via Gradescope.com.

(1) This exercise and the next concern predicate logic with a unary re-
lation symbol M, and binary relation symbols S and T, as well as
constants Joe, Ellen, Matt, Alex, Elizabeth, etc. We interpret M(x)
to mean that x is a man. S(x,y) to mean that x has seen y, and
T (x,y) to mean that x has talked to y.

Write sentences of predicate logic that express the same thing as
the following sentences of English. (For purposes of this problem,
‘is a woman means the same thing as ‘is not a mar’.)

(a) Alex is a woman.

(b) Joe has seen Matt but has not talked to him.

(c) Ellen has talked to everybody.

(d) Elizabeth has talked to everyone Matt did.

(e) Alex has talked to no one but possibly himself.

(£) Everyone who has seen Elizabeth has talked to her.

(g) No man has seen every woman.

(h) Some man has talked to every woman, but no woman has ever

talked to him.

(2) Now solve the problem in the other direction: Take the following

sentences of predicate logic, and translate them into sentences of
English, using the same interpretation. (Insofar as possible, the
sentences should be in precise but natural-sounding English, not
in math-ese. So avoid expressions like ‘for all’, ‘there exists’, and ‘if

then’.)

(a) S(Matt,Joe) A aT (Joe, Matt).

(b) Vx(-M(x) > aT (Steve, x)).

(c) Ax(M(x) A S(Elizabeth,x)).

(d) Vx((-M(x) A S(x,Joe)) + T (Joe,x)).

(e) Ax(M(x) A S(Elizabeth,x) A Vy((M(y) A S(Elizabeth, y)) > (x
(f) VxdyS(x,y).

(g) SyvxS(x,y).

(h) Axdy(S@x,y) AS(y,2) AT (xy) AT(,2))-

y)))

(3) Quantifiers are called quantifiers because they express something

about the number of elements that satisfy a certain property. Show

how to express the following ‘quantified’ statements in predicate

logic with a unary relation symbol R. You don’t have to introduce

any new quantifiers to do this, although you will need to keep in

A firm wants to know what motivates production workers who make handmade cigars. Does
criticism work better, or praise? Bosses gave each worker was given a randomly chosen num-
ber of punishments (reprimands), and a randomly chosen number of rewards (compliments)
throughout the workday. Your dataset has three variables, all measured during the day of
the study:

Y; is the number of cigars produced by worker 7,
X; is the number of times worker 7 was rewarded, and
Z; is the number of times worker i was punished.

The regression model is
Yi = a+ BXi + Zi + bi.
Here’s what the data looks like:

Worker ID | #Cigars produced | #Rewards | #Punishments
1 | 300 2 | 3
2 251 0 6
3 324 4 1
4 401 a 2
5 234 0 5. 0

a) Originally the firm wanted to fix the ratio of rewards to punishments to eae 3:1 for every
worker. What ae you think of this idea? {

Unfortunately, the general findings of the experiments closely align with my prior
knowledge of human decision making. Daniel Kahneman’s structure of System 1 and System 2
within human mind comes close to explaining the process of jumping to conclusions in situations

exemplified in this experiment. System 1 is in charge of the person when making a rapid
decision, as the slow and calculating System 2 is not quick enough to react on time for the
experiment. And in order to respond rapidly, System 1 latches onto any bits of extra information
that can help the subconscious mind get a fuller picture. As the subconscious sees the color of
skin, it will look for associations with that color. Unfortunately, people in the US have been
exposed to news of black violence for centuries and a subconscious association of black skin and
violence exists in many Americans (as shown in Experiment 3). Thus, when System | finds the
association of dark skin and violence, it can jump into a quick conclusion that the target is

violent. This is the downside of the inherently biased System 1.

The researchers appeared to measure various factors when testing the decision making
process of the participants. The primary reason of the existence of experiment #3 was to measure
additional data in experiment one. Overall, it appears to me that the researchers made their best
efforts to test for different factors that might affect the quick decision making process among
students and residents of Denver. In the end, I believe in the conclusions of the researchers that
the existence of “Shooter Bias” was related to perceptions of the cultural stereotype, and not

merely the conscious prejudice of the participant of the experiment.

Unfortunately, people in the US have been exposed to news of black violence for centuries and a subconscious association of black skin and violence exists in many Americans (as shown in Experiment 3).

Overall, it appears to me that the researchers made their best efforts to test for different factors that might affect the quick decision making process among students and residents of Denver. In the end, I believe in the conclusions of the researchers that the existence of “Shooter Bias” was related to perceptions of the cultural stereotype, and not merely the conscious prejudice of the participant of the experiment.

page 4: 4. Avoid highlighting, crossing out, or typing or printing outside the area provided for a response. If you must make
substantial corrections to your Form N-400, USCIS recommends that you start a new Form N-400 rather than using
correction tape or fluid to correct the information. USCIS scanners may see through the white correction tape or fluid.
This may lead to incorrect information being captured in USCIS systems, which may cause processing delays or a
rejection (non-acceptance) of your Form N-400.

5. Provide your A-Number on the top right corner of each page (if any). Your A-Number is located on your Permanent
Resident Card (formerly known as the Alien Registration Card). The A-Number on your card consists of a seven to
nine digit number, depending on when your record was created. If the A-Number on your card has fewer than nine
digits, place enough zeros before the first number to make a total of nine digits on Form N-400. For example, type or
print number A1234567 as A001234567 or type or print number A12345678 as A012345678.

6. Your application must be properly completed, signed, and filed. You must include all pages when you file Form
N-400, even if the pages are blank. A photocopy of the application is acceptable as long as all signatures on the
application are handwritten and original. USCIS will not accept a stamped or typewritten name in place of a
signature.

Early Filing. An applicant filing under the general naturalization provision (section 316(a) of the INA) may file his or
her application up to 90 days before he or she would first meet the required 5-year period of continuous residence as a
lawful permanent resident (LPR). An applicant filing as the spouse of a U.S. citizen under section 319(a) of the INA may
file up to 90 days before meeting the required 3-year period of continuous residence as an LPR. Although an applicant
may file early according to the 90-day early filing provision, the applicant is not eligible for naturalization until he or she
has reached the required 3- or 5-year period of continuous residence as an LPR. Applicants filing up to 90 days before
meeting the continuous residence requirement must still meet all other requirements for naturalization at the time of filing
Form N-400. For example, an applicant filing under section 319(a) of the INA must meet all other requirements as the
spouse of a U.S. citizen at the time of filing.

Part 3. Accommodations for Individuals with Disabilities and/or Impairments

USCIS is committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and/or
impairments that will help them fully participate in USCIS programs and benefits. Reasonable accommodations vary with
each disability and/or impairment. They may involve modifications to practices or procedures. There are various types of
reasonable accommodations that USCIS may offer. Examples include but are not limited to:

1. Ifyou are deaf or hard of hearing, USCIS may provide you with a sign-language interpreter at an interview or other
immigration benefit-related appointment;

2. Ifyou are blind or have low vision, USCIS may permit you to take a test orally rather than in writing; or

3. Ifyou are unable to travel to a designated USCIS location for an interview, USCIS may visit you at your home or
hospital to conduct the naturalization interview.

If you believe that you need USCIS to accommodate your disability and/or impairment, select “Yes” and then any
applicable box in Items A. - C. in Item Number 1. that describes the nature of your disabilities and/or impairments.
Also, describe the types of accommodations you are requesting on the lines provided. If you are requesting a sign-
language interpreter, indicate for which language (for example American Sign Language). If you need extra space to
complete this section, use a separate sheet of paper.

NOTE: All domestic USCIS facilities meet the Accessibility Guidelines of the Americans with Disabilities Act, so you
do not need to contact USCIS to request an accommodation for physical access to a domestic USCIS office. However, in
Part 3., Item C. in Item Number 1. of this application, you can indicate whether you use a wheelchair. This will allow
USCIS to better prepare for your visit.

NOTE: USCIS also ensures that limited English proficient (LEP) individuals are provided meaningful access at an
interview or other immigration benefit-related appointment, unless otherwise prohibited by law. LEP individuals may
bring a qualified interpreter to the interview.

USCIS considers requests for reasonable accommodations on a case-by-case basis, and we will make our best efforts to
reasonably accommodate your disabilities and/or impairments. USCIS will not exclude you from participating in USCIS
programs or deny your application because of your disabilities and/or impairments. Requesting and/or receiving an
accommodation will not affect your eligibility for an immigration benefit.

Part 4. Information to Contact You

Provide your current telephone numbers as well as your current email address. Type or print “N/A” if an item is not
applicable or if the answer is “none” unless otherwise indicated. If you are hearing impaired and use a TTY telephone
connection, indicate this by writing “TTY” after the telephone number.

Part 5. Information About Your Residence

List every address where you have lived during the last 5 years (including other countries) prior to filing your Form
N-400. Start with where you live now, and then include the dates for each place you have lived in a month, day, and year
format (mm/dd/yyyy). For example, type or print May 1, 1998 to June 1, 1999 as 05/01/1998 to 06/01/1999.

Provide your mailing address if it is different from your current address. Provide “In Care Of Name” information, if
applicable.

If you do not have a State or Province, enter the name of your city again in that box. If you do not have a ZIP or Postal
Code, enter “00000” in the ZIP or Postal Code box.

meaning because of a physical or developmental disability or mental impairment. For more information, see A Guide to

What Is the Filing Fee?

The filing fee for Form N-400 is $640. A biometric services fee of $85 is also required for applicants under 75 years of age
when filing Form N-400 regardless of where the applicant lives and whether the applicant is filing from within the United
States or abroad.

NOTE: No filing fee is required for military applicants filing under section 328 or 329 of the INA.

Biometric Services Fee Exceptions

You do not have to pay a biometric services fee if:

1. You are 75 years of age or older; or

2. You are filing under the military provisions, Section 328 or 329 of the INA.

USCIS cannot accept a biometric services fee if you are not required to pay a biometric services fee.

Rejected Applications

USCIS will reject your Form N-400 if you submit the incorrect fee or an incorrect payment method. USCIS also
will reject your Form N-400 if you include payment for more than what you are required to pay.

In the event USCIS rejects your application, we will return any filing fees with your application.
Use the following guidelines when you are paying for your application. You must:

1. Pay for each application using a single payment method (check, money order, or credit card) and not a combination of
methods; and

2. Use the same payment method for all applications that are mailed together.

NOTE: You must submit all fees in the exact amounts. The filing fee and biometric services fee are not refundable,

Fee Reduction

You may be eligible for a fee reduction. To qualify for the reduced fee, your household income must be greater than 150
percent and not more than 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, at the time of filing, based on your household
size. The Federal Poverty Guidelines are established by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services
annually. To obtain information on the current Federal Poverty Guidelines, visit our website at www.uscis.gov/I-942P
and review Form I-942P, Income Guidelines for Reduced Fees.

If you believe you are eligible for a fee reduction, complete Form I-942, Request for Reduced Fee, and submit it and any
required evidence to support your request with this application. If you are under 75 years of age, there is no reduction
available for the biometric services fee. If your request for reduced fee is approved you will pay $320 plus $85 for a total
payment of $405. You do not have to pay a biometric services fee if you are 75 years of age or older.

NOTE: USCIS cannot accept a biometric services fee if you are not required to pay a biometric services fee. USCIS will
reject your Form N-400 if you submit the incorrect fee or if you attach payment for more than what you are required to
pay. In such a case, USCIS will return any filing fees you submitted with your Form N-400.

USCIS Compliance Review and Monitoring

By signing this application, you have stated under penalty of perjury (28 U.S.C. section 1746) that all information and
documentation submitted with this application is complete, true, and correct. You also authorize the release of any
information from your records that USCIS may need to determine your eligibility for the immigration benefit you are
seeking and consent to USCIS verifying such information.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has the authority to verify any information you submit to establish
eligibility for the immigration benefit you are seeking at any time. USCIS’ legal authority to verify this information is in
8 U.S.C. sections 1103, 1155, and 1184; and 8 CFR Parts 103, 204, 205, 214, 316, and 336. To ensure compliance with
applicable laws and authorities, USCIS may verify information before or after your case is decided.

Agency verification methods may include, but are not limited to, review of public records and information; contact via
written correspondence, the Internet, facsimile, other electronic transmission, or telephone; unannounced physical site
inspections of residences and locations of employment; and interviews. USCIS will use information obtained through
verification to assess your compliance with the laws and to determine your eligibility for an immigration benefit.

Subject to the restrictions under 8 CFR 103.2(b)(16), USCIS will provide you with an opportunity to address any adverse
or derogatory information that may result from a USCIS compliance review, verification, or site visit after a formal
decision is made on your case or after the agency has initiated an adverse action which may result in revocation or
termination of an approval.

Abstract

The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or
convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best
performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention
mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer,
based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions
entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to
be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly
less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-
to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including
ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,
our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after
training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the
best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to
other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with
large and limited training data.

1 Introduction

Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [[7] neural networks
in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and

“Equal contribution. Listing order is random. Jakob proposed replacing RNNs with self-attention and started
the effort to evaluate this idea. Ashish, with Illia, designed and implemented the first Transformer models and
has been crucially involved in every aspect of this work. Noam proposed scaled dot-product attention, multi-head
attention and the parameter-free position representation and became the other person involved in nearly every
detail. Niki designed, implemented, tuned and evaluated countless model variants in our original codebase and
tensor2tensor. Llion also experimented with novel model variants, was responsible for our initial codebase, and
efficient inference and visualizations. Lukasz and Aidan spent countless long days designing various parts of and
implementing tensor2tensor, replacing our earlier codebase, greatly improving results and massively accelerating
our research.

page 2: transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35] [2) [5]. Numerous
efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder
architectures

Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output
sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden
states h;, as a function of the previous hidden state h,_; and the input for position t. This inherently
sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer
sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved
significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks and conditional
computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental
constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.

Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-
tion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in
the input or output sequences 9}. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms
are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.

In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead
relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.
The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in
translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.

2 Background

The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU
, ByteNet and Conv$2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building
block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,
the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows
in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes
it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is
reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due
to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as
described in section

Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions
of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been
used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,
textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4] |27) [28] (22].

End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-
aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and
language modeling tasks [34].

To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying
entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-
aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate
self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [L and [9].

3. Model Architecture

Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure 5) [2] 35).
Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ...,7,) to a sequence
of continuous representations z = (z1,...,2n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output
sequence (yj, ..., Ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive
[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.

The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully
connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure[I]
respectively.

3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks

Encoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two
sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-

wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [1
the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [I]. That is, the output of

itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well
layers, produce outputs of dimension dmode = 512.

each sub-layer is
LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer() is the function implemented by the sub-layer

as the embedding

Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two

sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which per:

orms multi-head

attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections

around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify

the self-attention

sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This
masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the

predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less tl

An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value

pairs to an output,

where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum
of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the

query with the corresponding key.

page 4: Scaled Dot-Product Attention Multi-Head Attention

Linear

Figure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several
attention layers running in parallel.

3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention

We call our particular attention "Scaled Dot-Product Attention" (Figure 2). The input consists of
queries and keys of dimension dx, and values of dimension d,. We compute the dot products of the
query with all keys, divide each by \/d;, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the
values.

In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together
into a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices kK and V. We compute
the matrix of outputs as:

Attention(Q, K,V) = softmax( 2 yy qd)
_ : Vdk

The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention (2), and dot-product (multi-
plicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor
of TE Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with

ke
a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is
much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized
matrix multiplication code.

While for small values of dj, the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms
dot product attention without scaling for larger values of d;, [3]. We suspect that for large values of
d;,, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has
extremely small gradients To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by TE

3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention

Instead of performing a single attention function with dmodei-dimensional keys, values and queries,
we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned
linear projections to d;,, d;, and d,, dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of
queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding d,,-dimensional
output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as
depicted in Figure[2]

‘To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random
variables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, g -k = ves, qiki, has mean 0 and variance dx.

In this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use
dy, = dy = dmoaei/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost
is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.

3.2.3. Applications of Attention in our Model
The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:

e In "encoder-decoder attention" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,
and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every
position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the

ical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as

(9).

e The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values
and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the
encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the
encoder.

e Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to
all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward
information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this
inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to —oo) all values in the input
of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure[2|

3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks

In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully
connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This
consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.

FFN(x) = max(0,7W, + b1)W2 + bz (2)

While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters
from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.
The dimensionality of input and output is dmode) = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality
dy 5 = 2048.

3.4 Embeddings and Softmax

Similarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input
tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmode!. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-
mation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In
our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax
linear transformation, similar to [BO]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by V/dmouel-

3.5 Positional Encoding

Since our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the
order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the

tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add "positional encodings" to the input embeddings at the
bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel
as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,
learned and fixed [9].

In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:

PE (pos,21) = sin(pos/100007"/ 4%")
PE (pos,21-41) = €08(pos/ 10000?*/4mese!)

where pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding
corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 27 to 10000 - 27. We
chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by
relative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PE,..+, can be represented as a linear function of
PEpos-

We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two
versions produced nearly identical results (see Table [3] row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version
because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered
during training.

4 Why Self-Attention

In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-
tional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations
(x1,...,%p,) to another sequence of equal length (21,...,2,), with x;, 2; € R%, such as a hidden
layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we
consider three desiderata.

One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can
be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.

The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range
dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the
ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to
traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input
and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare
the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the
different layer types.

As noted in Table[]] a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially
executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of
computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence
length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with
sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece
(B8] and byte-pair [BI] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving
very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in

path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.

A single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output
positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,
or O(log,(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths
between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than
recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity
considerably, to O(k -n +d + n-d?). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable
convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,
the approach we take in our model.

As side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions
from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention
heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic
and semantic structure of the sentences.

5 Training
This section describes the training regime for our models.

5.1 Training Data and Batching

We trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million
sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-
target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT
2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece
vocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training
batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000
target tokens.

5.2. Hardware and Schedule

We trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using
the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We
trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the
bottom line of table), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps
(3.5 days).

5.3. Optimizer

We used the Adam optimizer with 3; = 0.9, 82 = 0.98 and € = 10~°. We varied the learning
rate over the course of training, according to the formula:

lrate = doe : min(step_num~°°, step_num - warmup_steps'°) (3)
This corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,
and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used
warmup_steps = 4000.

5.4 Regularization

We employ three types of regularization during training:

Residual Dropout We apply dropout to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the
sub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the
positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of
Parop = 0.1.

6 Results

6.1 Machine Translation

On the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)
in Table|2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0
BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is
listed in the bottom line of Table[3| Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model
surpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of
the competitive models.

On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,
outperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the
previous state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used
dropout rate Parop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.

For the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which
were written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We
used beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty « = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters
were chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during
inference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].

Table[2]summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model
architectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a
model by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained
single-precision floating-point capacity of each GPup|

6.2. Model Variations

To evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model
in different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the
development set, newstest2013. We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no
checkpoint averaging. We present these results in Table[3]

In Table[3|rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,
keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section While single-head
attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.

>We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TEFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.

page 10: constraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence
models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].

We trained a 4-layer transformer with djode, = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the
Penn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,
using the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences
(B7). We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens
for the semi-supervised setting.

We performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual
(section|5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters
remained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we
increased the maximum output length to input length + 300. We used a beam size of 21 and a = 0.3
for both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.

Our results in Table [4] show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs sur-
prisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the
Recurrent Neural Network Grammar [8].

In contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [37], the Transformer outperforms the Berkeley-
Parser even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.

7 Conclusion

In this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on
attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with
multi-headed self-attention.

For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based
on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014
English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best
model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.

We are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We
plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and
to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs
such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.

Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37]. We trained a 4-layer transformer with djode, = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting, using the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences (B7). We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens for the semi-supervised setting. We performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual (section|5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters remained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we increased the maximum output length to input length + 300. We used a beam size of 21 and a = 0.3 for both '}

Our results in Table [4] show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs sur- prisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar [8]. In contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [37], the Transformer outperforms the Berkeley- Parser even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences. 7 Conclusion In this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention. For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all '}

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism.

Abstract

The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or
convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best
performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention
mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer,
based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions
entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to
be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly
less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-
to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including
ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,
our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after
training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the
best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to
other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with
large and limited training data.

1 Introduction

Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [[7] neural networks
in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and

“Equal contribution. Listing order is random. Jakob proposed replacing RNNs with self-attention and started
the effort to evaluate this idea. Ashish, with Illia, designed and implemented the first Transformer models and
has been crucially involved in every aspect of this work. Noam proposed scaled dot-product attention, multi-head
attention and the parameter-free position representation and became the other person involved in nearly every
detail. Niki designed, implemented, tuned and evaluated countless model variants in our original codebase and
tensor2tensor. Llion also experimented with novel model variants, was responsible for our initial codebase, and
efficient inference and visualizations. Lukasz and Aidan spent countless long days designing various parts of and
implementing tensor2tensor, replacing our earlier codebase, greatly improving results and massively accelerating
our research.

page 2: transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35] [2) [5]. Numerous
efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder
architectures

Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output
sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden
states h;, as a function of the previous hidden state h,_; and the input for position t. This inherently
sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer
sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved
significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks and conditional
computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental
constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.

Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-
tion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in
the input or output sequences 9}. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms
are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.

In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead
relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.
The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in
translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.

2 Background

The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU
, ByteNet and Conv$2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building
block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,
the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows
in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes
it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is
reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due
to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as
described in section

Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions
of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been
used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,
textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4] |27) [28] (22].

End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-
aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and
language modeling tasks [34].

To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying
entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-
aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate
self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [L and [9].

3. Model Architecture

Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure 5) [2] 35).
Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ...,7,) to a sequence
of continuous representations z = (z1,...,2n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output
sequence (yj, ..., Ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive
[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.

The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully
connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure[I]
respectively.

3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks

Encoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two
sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-

wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [1
the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [I]. That is, the output of

itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well
layers, produce outputs of dimension dmode = 512.

each sub-layer is
LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer() is the function implemented by the sub-layer

as the embedding

Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two

sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which per:

orms multi-head

attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections

around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify

the self-attention

sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This
masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the

predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less tl

An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value

pairs to an output,

where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum
of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the

query with the corresponding key.

Linear

Figure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several
attention layers running in parallel.

3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention

We call our particular attention "Scaled Dot-Product Attention" (Figure 2). The input consists of
queries and keys of dimension dx, and values of dimension d,. We compute the dot products of the
query with all keys, divide each by \/d;, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the
values.

In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together
into a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices kK and V. We compute
the matrix of outputs as:

Attention(Q, K,V) = softmax( 2 yy qd)
_ : Vdk

The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention (2), and dot-product (multi-
plicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor
of TE Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with

ke
a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is
much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized
matrix multiplication code.

While for small values of dj, the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms
dot product attention without scaling for larger values of d;, [3]. We suspect that for large values of
d;,, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has
extremely small gradients To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by TE

3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention

Instead of performing a single attention function with dmodei-dimensional keys, values and queries,
we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned
linear projections to d;,, d;, and d,, dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of
queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding d,,-dimensional
output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as
depicted in Figure[2]

‘To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random
variables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, g -k = ves, qiki, has mean 0 and variance dx.

In this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use
dy, = dy = dmoaei/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost
is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.

3.2.3. Applications of Attention in our Model
The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:

e In "encoder-decoder attention" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,
and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every
position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the

ical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as

(9).

e The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values
and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the
encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the
encoder.

e Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to
all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward
information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this
inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to —oo) all values in the input
of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure[2|

3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks

In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully
connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This
consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.

FFN(x) = max(0,7W, + b1)W2 + bz (2)

While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters
from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.
The dimensionality of input and output is dmode) = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality
dy 5 = 2048.

3.4 Embeddings and Softmax

Similarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input
tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmode!. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-
mation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In
our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax
linear transformation, similar to [BO]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by V/dmouel-

3.5 Positional Encoding

Since our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the
order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the

tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add "positional encodings" to the input embeddings at the
bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel
as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,
learned and fixed [9].

In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:

PE (pos,21) = sin(pos/100007"/ 4%")
PE (pos,21-41) = €08(pos/ 10000?*/4mese!)

where pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding
corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 27 to 10000 - 27. We
chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by
relative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PE,..+, can be represented as a linear function of
PEpos-

We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two
versions produced nearly identical results (see Table [3] row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version
because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered
during training.

4 Why Self-Attention

In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-
tional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations
(x1,...,%p,) to another sequence of equal length (21,...,2,), with x;, 2; € R%, such as a hidden
layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we
consider three desiderata.

One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can
be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.

The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range
dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the
ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to
traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input
and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare
the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the
different layer types.

As noted in Table[]] a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially
executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of
computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence
length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with
sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece
(B8] and byte-pair [BI] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving
very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in

path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.

A single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output
positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,
or O(log,(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths
between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than
recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity
considerably, to O(k -n +d + n-d?). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable
convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,
the approach we take in our model.

As side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions
from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention
heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic
and semantic structure of the sentences.

5 Training
This section describes the training regime for our models.

5.1 Training Data and Batching

We trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million
sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-
target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT
2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece
vocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training
batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000
target tokens.

5.2. Hardware and Schedule

We trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using
the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We
trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the
bottom line of table), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps
(3.5 days).

5.3. Optimizer

We used the Adam optimizer with 3; = 0.9, 82 = 0.98 and € = 10~°. We varied the learning
rate over the course of training, according to the formula:

lrate = doe : min(step_num~°°, step_num - warmup_steps'°) (3)
This corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,
and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used
warmup_steps = 4000.

5.4 Regularization

We employ three types of regularization during training:

Residual Dropout We apply dropout to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the
sub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the
positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of
Parop = 0.1.

Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source- target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT 2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece vocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000 target tokens. 5.2.

6 Results

6.1 Machine Translation

On the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)
in Table|2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0
BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is
listed in the bottom line of Table[3| Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model
surpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of
the competitive models.

On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,
outperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the
previous state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used
dropout rate Parop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.

For the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which
were written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We
used beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty « = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters
were chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during
inference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].

Table[2]summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model
architectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a
model by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained
single-precision floating-point capacity of each GPup|

6.2. Model Variations

To evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model
in different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the
development set, newstest2013. We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no
checkpoint averaging. We present these results in Table[3]

In Table[3|rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,
keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section While single-head
attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.

>We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TEFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.

In Table Blrows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size d;, hurts model quality. This
suggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility
function than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,
bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our
sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical
results to the base model.

We trained a 4-layer transformer with djode, = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the
Penn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,
using the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences
(B7). We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens
for the semi-supervised setting.

We performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual
(section|5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters
remained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we
increased the maximum output length to input length + 300. We used a beam size of 21 and a = 0.3
for both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.

Our results in Table [4] show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs sur-
prisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the
Recurrent Neural Network Grammar [8].

In contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [37], the Transformer outperforms the Berkeley-
Parser even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.

7 Conclusion

In this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on
attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with
multi-headed self-attention.

For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based
on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014
English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best
model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.

We are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We
plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and
to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs
such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.

Course Description

This course is devoted to reading different articles from various Russian media about
political/economic/business/criminal/cultural events. Discussion of related topics will
follow reading articles and elaborating on new vocabulary from them (Russian journalistic
style consist of a combination of written and conversational speech). Articles or new items
will be analyzed in content.

Objective

Through a mixture of media in Russian, learners will be able to analyze
current events, converse and think critically about them in Russian. Reading
articles which will be organized in a specific way to help learners gain and
remember new, useful vocabulary which will allow them to discuss different
serious topics in Russian.

Outcome

Upon completion of this course, learners will be able to read Russian press
and to hold a very complex conversation about the news in Russia in all
forms of media. They will also be able to write a résumé of news happening
in Russia.

Topics

Rigorous use of multi-media vocabulary; idiomatic expressions; news
vocabulary; analytic style of writing in Russian.

Textbook

Current news from the Internet, the course packs “Reading for Speaking”
and varied supplementary materials.

Lessons

3 chapters of the course pack and varied supplementary materials.

Platform

This course is taught solely online or by using our hybrid IDL (interactive
distance learning) format. In Hybrid clases, some students are in-person
while others join the class remotely via Zoom. ILI uses a 360-degree camera

To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence- aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [L and [9]. 3. Model Architecture Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure 5) [2] 35). Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ...,7,) to a sequence of continuous representations z = (z1,...,2n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output sequence (yj, ..., Ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.

Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states h;, as a function of the previous hidden state h,_; and the input for position t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.

This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4] |27) [28] (22].

For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers.
